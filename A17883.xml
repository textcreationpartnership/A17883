            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O why hath not my pen the vertue to cure the wounds that theſe wicked books cauſe in this world! or at
<pb facs="tcp:7827:6"/> leaſt, why cannot it devoure thoſe monſters, which the writers of thoſe aforeſaid workes, meere inchanters of mindes cauſe to appeare in the formes of bookes? or like as an Eagles feather devours all other feathers, ſo might my pen devour all thoſe other pens. When ſhall the light of vertue, &amp; verity diſſipate the ſhadowes of vice and vanity? will the falſe Dagons never fall before the Arke of ſerious, true, and beneficiall entertainments of the minde? at leaſt if theſe my labours could cure thoſe who are miſerably infected with often viewing theſe Pamphlets: If the loſſe of ſo much time may be called imployment, I ſhould not thinke my labour ſpent in vaine, nor my pen unprofitable. But when I ſee this miſchievous tree, which I ſtrive to cut down, caſting forth ſo many branches, as I lop off, and doing like the Vine, which never ſprouts ſo well, as when it is cut, it makes me feare a labour like unto that of <hi>Danaides,</hi> or of <hi>Siſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus.</hi> Who would not wiſh for as many hands as <hi>Briarius,</hi> for to oppoſe ſo many ſtiles, which are uſed in that ſo vaine, and ſo wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton a kinde of writing? And who would not
<pb facs="tcp:7827:6"/> wiſh for the arme of <hi>Hercules,</hi> to overcome this <hi>Hydra,</hi> whereof I can no ſooner ſtrike off one head, but up ſprings another? You would thinke the fable of <hi>Cadmus</hi> a truth in this ſubject; and that of the ancient Serpents teeth, there growes up armed men to fight in defence of lyes: that if <hi>Hercules</hi> (according to the proverb) could doe nothing againſt two, what may we think to doe againſt theſe legions?</p>
                  <p>Now to overthrow ſo many fabulous Bookes, I undertake not my combat direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if I were confuting hereſies, for it is not needfull that I ſhould trouble my ſelf to prove the obſcurity of darkneſſe, nor to ſhew the falſhood of theſe Romants, Adventures, Chivalries, and other ſuch traſh, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelves fabulous in their Prefaces, and whoſe reading full of fantaſticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of faynings, of impoſſibilities, of abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, of inchantments, of extravagancies, and ſuch like trumpery, ſufficiently ſheweth their impertinency, which were (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith) to combat againſt the aire, and to tunne without end, or at the moſt to imitate
<pb facs="tcp:7827:7"/> that idle Emperour, who made warre onely againſt flyes By what manner doe I then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to overcome my adverſaries? it is by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, ſetting relations true and beneficiall, in the place of thoſe that are prophane, fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and not onely unprofitable, but for the moſt part pernicious, to the end that thoſe whoſe great leiſure cauſeth to ſeeke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to imploy their time, may finde where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to entertaine their deſires.</p>
                  <p>Even as truth is conſtant, ſo falſhood is wavering and differing, &amp; is capable of more different formes, then the <hi>materia prima,</hi> or the Proteus of Poets, which is the cauſe that theſe Authors, who love vanity, and follow after lyes, ſet forth their works in as many faſhions, as they pleaſe. This variety being no ſmall attractive unto thoſe that paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect ſuch kinde of reading: and it is no ſmall advantage, that fantaſticall relations have over thoſe that are true, for thoſe are made at pleaſure, like leaden rules, or images of waxe wherewith you may doe what you will, filling them with monſtrous incounters, ſurmounting both probability and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:7827:7"/> things which delight and wonderfully ſuſpend the minde: in briefe, they ſtuffe them with ſo many baits, that the licouriſhneſſe of the ſawce makes them looſe the taſte of the meat, which of it ſelfe is without ſavour or reliſh, and moſt commonly hurtfull: whereas narrations of things, which have truely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, are tyed to more ſubjection, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a man may order them handſomely, and ſlip in ſome convenient dreſſings, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe conſcience obliges to keep faithfully to the ground and body of the Hiſtory: and yet in the particularities which are added, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for connexion, or imbelliſhment of the recitall: the Author is ſtrictly tyed to the bounds of probability, out of which he may not ſwerve a nailes beadth, without diſcredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the whole worke. For although fables, parables, and poeticall fictions, do ſometimes hide in them good precepts, and many ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous examples, yet the inſtructions looſe much of their credit when they are mixed amongſt vaine inventions: and when they doe not leane to the ſolid foundation of truth, even as the Manna of <hi>Calabria</hi> looſeth much of its
<pb facs="tcp:7827:8"/> vertue, when it is gathered of flowers which grow in places that are too moiſt.</p>
                  <p>Now amongſt the multitude of theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which like unto Reeds, have nothing but a pleaſing verdure, and a faire ſhew of ſtately words, hollow and empty without any ſolid ſubſtance, there are one kinde, which may be called an Ants neſt, a ſeed-plot or nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of theſe wanton inventions, and that is it which beares the titles of tales and novels: amongſt Italians, thoſe of <hi>Boccace</hi> for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of language, are much eſteemed, but they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:7827:8"/> as pernitious to good manners, but alſo by publike deteſtation: true it is that there was amongſt the reſt, ſome ſad events which had beene gathered and tranſlated into our tongue by <hi>Bell Foreſt,</hi> whereof he hath fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his tragicall hiſtories, yet ſome of them would deſerve correction, being full of fleſh and bloud. They have alſo thoſe of <hi>Giraldy,</hi> of <hi>Sauſonin,</hi> of <hi>Straparolle,</hi> full of ſo much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe and diſhoneſty, that it is pitty to ſee theſe Bookes in the hands of youth, who ſucke this Heraclian honey (ſweet but vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous) through the ſight, and which by its reading, teacheth ſuch corruptions and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as but by the practiſe of moſt diſſolute perſons would never be taught them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, in all theſe ſtories (for the moſt part) invented at will, there is ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h manifeſt fopperies, and ſuch great want of judgement in the Authors, and of likelihood in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that it is a ſtrange thing, that reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirits can be payd with ſuch counterfeit and uncurrant coyne. Truely, wee are not men, but by reaſon, and when this light of our ſoule is out of its Eclipticke line, and
<pb facs="tcp:7827:9"/> ſtrayed from its way, we fall into bottomleſſe pits of abſurdities: but what ſhall we doe to cure thoſe that delight in their follies?</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the Spaniards, above all writers of Romants, and great tellers of tales, novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſtories, thoſe of <hi>Ceroantes</hi> are much eſteemed: and truely having red them, I have found his wit to be very great in thoſe ſmall things. A man of the world, a great gyber and ſcoffer, and who handſomely, and to the uttermoſt, ſets out his wares. <hi>Deigo Agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> hath followed theſe, adding unto his the ſurname of morall, becauſe of the morals which he drawes at the end of thoſe occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which he recites. This man in my minde is more judicious, and leſſe inſolent, although he takes licence to flye out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a little. Among our French, a fine wit, in truth, and who hath a fine ſtile, hath recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated himſelfe in writing French tales or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, which farre ſurpaſſe the Italian, and are no whit behinde the Spaniſh: he is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in his imaginations, and modeſt in his words, hee hath not deigned to ſet his name to this worke, wherein he ſeemes but to
<pb facs="tcp:7827:9"/> have onely tryed his penne, which he deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth to ſome higher and more ſerious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Another hath given us a taſte of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall diverſities, but this booke is ſo little, that it is but a ſhew, which breeds a wiſh for an ampler piece. Vnto this may be annexed the tragicall Hiſtories of <hi>Bell Forreſt,</hi> and thoſe made by <hi>Roſſet,</hi> bearing the ſame title.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the writings of that ſort, which have fallen under my view, not that I have taken patience to reade them diſtinctly, but I have runne over ſome pieces of them, only as to feele their pulſe, and informe my ſelfe of their language and Country. But for to ſay in generall what mine opinion is of theſe and all ſuch like confuſed heapes of frivolous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, I cannot better compare them then to dainty garden knots &amp; borders which have Serpents hidden under their flowers, or unto fine fields: pleaſing unto the eye, but full of Hemlocke and Aconitum, or unto Sallets, wherein are poyſonous hearbs, or unto thoſe fine Gold-Smiths workes, wherein are inſerted baſe mettals,
<pb facs="tcp:7827:10"/> and counterfeit ſtones, or unto thoſe liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh <hi>Spaniſh</hi> diſhes of meat, called <hi>pot porride,</hi> delicious in taſte, but prejudiciall to health; or unto the horſe of <hi>Troy,</hi> out of which came ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſouldiers, by whom that beautifull City was turned into aſhes. I ſay not this ſo much to diſgrace my adverſaries, as to give teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to truth.</p>
                  <p>Now (my deare Reader) it is this kinde of bookes which I ſtrive to ſupplant by theſe ſingular Events, which I heare offer unto thy view, thou ſhalt not ſee therein thoſe pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Eloquence, nor thoſe induſtrious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments wherewith thoſe Antagoniſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne their ridiculous tales, to make them glyde the ſweether into the mindes of them that ſpend time abouttheir Chymera's. But thou ſhalt here finde naturall beauties with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out art; I meane, examples which borrow all their grace and worth from the force of truth which upholds them, and whoſe teſtimonies are ſeene in the times, places, and perſons.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Events, which I call ſingular, as well for being rare and notable, as for having no connexion the one with the other, each
<pb facs="tcp:7827:10"/> one making its body, hath as it were underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, either to cry downe a vice, or to extoll a vertue. The eng <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ayme at, as being (as it is alſo the end of all good hiſtory) to withdraw from evill, and to excite unto good, to breed a holy horrour of bad actions, and a juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of actions that are good, ever (as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerves) adding a few words, ſhort, but preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, like to ſo many ſpurres, which pricke forward to well doing, and ſo many Bits which hold backe from the doing of evill, ſometimes ſhewing the recompnce of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſometimes the puniſhment of vice, to the end that love and feare may ſupport the good, and retaine the bad in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. This is the mark at which this worke wholly levels, whoſe intention at leaſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamed.</p>
                  <p>As for the manner I am to advertiſe thee, that I ſtudy as much as I can for brevity, and thereupon abridge it of all the trimmings with which I extend my other Hiſtories, where giving my minde ſcope, as in a full ſea, I hoyſe up ſayles, and run at large, as the courſe of my penne carries me: here I cut my
<pb facs="tcp:7827:11"/> Vine, and nip of its buds, yea I clip my wings to keep me from ſoaring: I keep cloſe to the matter, &amp; give little liberty unto my thoughts, to ſpread into digreſſions, if they be not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and as it were bred in the ſubject, by reaſon whereof I have weaned my ſelf from the ſweet milke of poeſie, and have abſtained from putting any verſes in theſe Events. I have alſo taken away the other graces, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtrophes, dialogiſmes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints, ſpeeches, conferences, letters, orations; in briefe, all that might enlarge or embelliſh, ſo that in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of our other relations, theſe are but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgements of hiſtories, and as it were Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letons, nothing remaining but the bones of each Event, ſtript of the ornaments which might have ſet forth their bodies in a far fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer hew. In the art of painting, little pieces have their graces, as well as great pictures, which have all their dimenſions: ſo have abridgements in their kindes, as well as lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ampler diſcourſes: and as ſtronger blowes are given by a ſhort weapon, then by a long; a wound with a Dagger being no leſſe dangerous, then that with a ſword: even ſo it
<pb facs="tcp:7827:11"/> happens that the mind draws more profit fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an example reſtrained within the bounds of its ſubject, then from another whoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous relations may either diſtract the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or leave it languiſhing: many times ſmal ſtreames are more delectable then great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and the leaſt ſprings more pleaſing then torrents, and meats cut in ſmall bits, are ſwallowed with moſt eaſe. There be mindes which foyle in reading a hiſtory of great length, humane patience being not of any great extent: but when Events are ſet downe in ſuch a manner, as the end is not farre from the beginning, this is it which incourageth the reader, and both giveth him a deſire of ſeeing further, and alſo eaſes him in reading, beſides variety is alwaies more delectable, and gives better content, then uniformity, &amp; pleaſure is a bait to a reader, which thoſe that write, ſhould in no wiſe contemne.</p>
                  <p>This booke of Events is a Garland made of many flowers, a honey compoſed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hearbs, whoſe juyces are different, a treacle made of divers ingredients, and wherein the Serpent of vice is ſeaſoned with ſo many
<pb facs="tcp:7827:12"/> antidotes, that in liew of hurting, it will doe good. It is a worke of inlaying, where each piece making its body, hath a ſeverall colour and vertue, and all together make a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, which will not be unpleaſant, except it be unto thoſe muddy unſettled ſpirits, who can like nothing of anothers doing, being burthenſome unto themſelves, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome unto all the world.</p>
                  <p>If I did write theſe Hiſtories rather to pleaſe men, then to benefit my neighbour, it may bee I ſhould be faine to feare their cenſures, and ſeeke to conjure or appeaſe their bad humours. But ſhould I entertaine ſuch a thought, as to purchaſe reputation in this world, then would I ſet my ſelfe in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other poſture, and would give unto my pen a ſubject more flaſhing, and ranging, but being too weake to ſoare into high matters, I am content that it ſhall keepe ſo low, even to touch the ground: and that bringing more profit to my neighbour, it ſhould yeeld little or no fame unto the Author.</p>
                  <p>Examples of good and evill have a like vertue, (provided) they meet with a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:7827:12"/> according in the ſoules of them that ſee them. For many reade books for curioſity, others for variety, or to paſſe time, and for want of other imployment, another with envy, few with ſincerity, few with a deſire to profit, and to put in practiſe the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions they finde therein; from whence proceeds the ill uſage of ſo many Authors, with ſo much ingratitude and cruelty; that who ſo ſets forth a Booke, expoſes himſelfe unto the mercy of mockers and detracters: drones which do but hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But let them ſay on, ſome good ſoules (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe) whoſe diſpoſitions are inclined to vertue, will be glad to finde profitable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions ſet do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:7827:13"/> which I have gathered in the great field of the world. It is your part, deare Reader, to extract honey out of the hardeſt ſtone, oyle out of the flint, ſtudying a reformation of manners in this ſchoole of humane actions; Remembring alwaies that the ſecret (and if I may ſo ſay) the great worke of prudence and juſtice, is to avoyd evill, and to imbrace good.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sapor</hi> was not above three or foure yeeres old when <hi>Venon</hi> paid nature the tribute, which all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane creatures owe, leaving both his wife, and daughter to the Dutcheſſe, who looked for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fortune, then what proceeded from her boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The little Prince affected his nurſe, and foſter ſiſter in ſuch a manner, that although he was now weaned, yet they both tended him, and waited on him.</p>
                     <p>But here we muſt obſerve, that as fire elevates the matters, whereinto it takes although they are of themſelves heavie, ſo likewiſe love raiſeth the hearts wherein it takes an impreſſion, and ſtirres
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7827:18"/> them up to motives, and actions farre ſurmounting, both the age, and condition of the parties. This I ſay in reſpect of the love, and affection which <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſana</hi> bore to <hi>Sapor,</hi> of whom, even in her infancy, ſhe was ſo taken, that this flame increaſing with her yeeres, arrived at laſt to perfection.</p>
                     <p>None will deny but that it is an errour condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to ſay that parents beget the ſoules as well as the bodies, knowing that their beginning comes immediately from God, but ſince the diſpoſition of temperature, and of the organs through which the ſpirit exerciſeth it's functions, hath great effect in regard of the firme union of the ſoule, and the body. It is no great wonder if that <hi>Roſana</hi> being ſprung from parents, whoſe inclinations were wholly to friendſhip, that her bloud and heart ſhould be addicted to this paſſion, otherwiſe might ſhe have beene rather thought a monſter in nature, if ſhe ſhould not have partaked of the qualities of thoſe that begat her, let us neither ſpare the rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, nor let paſſe the praiſe due unto her faithfull affection, ſince that both honeſty, and generoſity have beene the wings wherewith it hath mounted thus high. Things that are aſhamed of ſight moſt commonly ſeeke darkneſſe, wherin to ſhroud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but thoſe that are vertuous, walke in the light of the day; why ſhould we bluſh for being in love? there is nothing ſo much commendable as that which is guided by purity. The law of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians is wholly grounded upon love; we are not aſhamed to ſhew our love to a picture, to a horſe, or a hound: we thinke nothing to good for them: why
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7827:18"/> then ſhould we bee aſhamed to cheriſh a reaſonable creature? a perſon well deſcended, well bred, who reſpects nought ſave honour, and vertue, which are the moſt amiableſt qualities. For beauty is but the weake wind thereof, and a thing which ought to be taken but as the badge of goodnes, even as the bloſſomes on a tree are onely praiſed for the fruits, which ſhall come of them. Verily the Elements which give us our being, and life are not more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary then mutuall love, and friendſhip. But whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth this thought carry me againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe I have made, not to let my penne flye out too far, nor inſiſt too long upon any particular? but the reaſon is, that I have in hand a vertue ſo heroicall, that the ſingularity thereof hath drawne from me thoſe few words in it's commendation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Roſana</hi> (as you have heard) loved <hi>Sapor</hi> in her infancy, with ſuch an extraordinary fervour, that aſſoone as ſhe loſt the ſight of him, ſhe did nothing but weepe and complaine, for this Prince was the Adamant of her heart, and ſhe was the Marigold, whereof he was the Sunne, never was there ſeene in ſo tender yeeres ſo ſtrong a paſſion, all the world wondred at it; and the Duke and Dutches tooke therein an incomparable pleaſure: they often paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed time in vexing this little creature, by threatning to put her away from the Prince, to which ſhe would reply in ſuch a manner as could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from ſo ſmall an age, or ſo little ſtrength, and like an Amazon ſought to fight with all thoſe, who ſought to take her joy from her.</p>

                     <p>In their firſt infancy, which unites the tongue, they without ceremony called brother and ſiſter, and every one wondred at the courage, and boldneſſe of this little girle, when ſhe grew bigger, ſhe called the Prince her Maſter, and he called her his Page.</p>
                     <p>All the exerciſes which the Maſter learned the Page did learne, and which is the more to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7827:19"/> ſhe learned them with ſuch a grace, that ſhe ſeemed afterwards for a mirrour or example to her little Maſter, As Phyſicke is given to the nurſe that ſo through the milke the child may be cured, ſo was it with <hi>Sapor,</hi> for when they were to give him any leſſon, either of dancing, ſtudy, or any thing elſe, they firſt taught it to his Page, ſhe learned the faſter to pleaſe him, and he tooke the greater care that he might not be outſtript by a girle, an emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vertue without envie.

                     <p>It hapned ſometimes that the other Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would blam her for this her extream affection, which ſhe ſhewed towards the Prince, ſeeing the difference of their eſtates, and the modeſty which ſhe owed to her ſexe, but thereunto ſhe anſwered, that ſhe loved him, as a ſiſter ought to love a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with the ſame reverence, that a ſlave beares to his Lord.</p>
                     <p>The Prince on his part bore with no leſſe impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the privation of his Pages converſation, and it was his greateſt contentment, when he could ſlip in amongſt the Gentlewomen, thereby to entertain her at will, who poſſeſſed his thoughts.</p>
                     <p>Lewd deſires being entred into his ſpirits with knowledge, changed his love intoſenſuality, which could not be juſt, being that marriage was not his ayme, notwithſtanding, as he long ſince knew the honeſty of this creature, who for a kingdome would not have blemiſhed her integrity; he diſſembled a long time his pretention, but being not able any longer to beare the impetuoſity of his appetites, he would on a time have paſſed unto ſome unſeemely, and unbefitting action, which this generous Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon would by no meanes endure, but told him,

                     <p>Friendſhip is not idle where it ſettles, it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls to worke; that it may make it ſelfe more knowne by effects, then by words. <hi>Sapor</hi> deſirous to advance this young Gentleman thought he could not more befriend him, then in giving him for his wife, her whom he affected as his ſiſter: And her whom hee could well have wiſhed for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if the glory of his birth had not obliged him, by reaſon of ſtate; to ſeeke a match confor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mable to his quality.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Numerian</hi> held for a great favour the motion, which the new Duke made him of this marriage; conſidering with himſelfe that it was the onely meanes to eſtabliſh his fortune in this great houſe. The Prince himſelfe alſo moved it to <hi>Roſana,</hi> who anſwered him with her accuſtomed generoſity, as followeth: Maſter (ſaid ſhe) will it not be a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to give this body to a man who ſhall not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the heart, being ſo filled with the honeſt love it beares you; that there is no place voyde for any other ſubject: permit me (my deare Prince) to die
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7827:22"/> a virgin, and with the glory of a veſtall, who hath not let her fire goe out; The permiſſion which I have had to love you, I hold for ſo great an honour; and the happineffe of your reciprocall friendſhip, is ſo precious in my memory, that I ſhould think my ſelfe a baſtard Eagle, that having faſtned mine eyes on ſo great a light, ſhould now remove them on ſome leſſer ſtarre; permit me to be an Heliotropean (the hearb Turneſole) and that I may cloſe up the leaves of my affections to all other lights, but only to that which gives me day. It is not that I pretend any other thing in my love, but the contentment I finde in honouring you; and you know that I have often proteſted that the happineſſe to waite upon you, ſufficiently payes the reward of all my ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For all the recompence which I looke for from you, is to be, and ſo to dye, yours; Neither doe I diſdaine <hi>Numerian</hi> being a brave, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gentleman; and of whoſe merit, although I had no other proofes ſave your eſtimation, it would be ſufficient, to make me reſpect him. For your judgement is my law, and your will my rule. No, unto what degree ſoever your goodneſſe ſhall raiſe me, yet I ſhall never forget the meaneneſſe of my condition. But I am of that opinion, that I ſhould love that faire image, which love for you hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in my heart, if I ſhould lodge another therein, which hath made me deſire to live, and dye as I am.</p>
                     <p>Siſter (ſaid the Prince raviſhed in admiration at the courage of this female) if I thought the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age which I propound unto you, ſhould never ſo
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7827:23"/> little diminiſh the affection you beare me, I would never conſent thereunto, nothing being ſo pretious to me, as to ſee my ſelf beloved, and ſo fervently by a ſubject ſo amiable, but becauſe the love that you ſhall beare to him as your husband, ſhall not bee contrary to that which you beare to me, as being your brother, I did verily believe that this marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age would bring neither to me, to him, or to you any manner of prejudice. Love is like honour, which varies it ſelfe according to the qualities of the perſons, or like unto the Pourcontrell, or Peake fiſh, who becomes of the ſame colour the things are, whereon it faſtens, ſo that a man may love di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers perſons with all his heart, according to divers reſpects, a father, as a father, a mother, as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a husband, as a husband, and a brother, as a brother: This flame of love extends it ſelf like unto the flame of a torch, which lights many others without waſting it ſelfe; and it is thus that I intend to give you unto <hi>Numerian,</hi> you know I love him, but with a far inferiour affection to that I bare you, my deſire is to advance him, and likewiſe you, ſo that when you are joyned together I ſhall have a double cauſe to do you good, and to gratifie you in what I may.</p>
                     <p>By theſe reaſons which were as plauſible, as true, <hi>Roſana</hi> (who ſaw but through the eyes of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por</hi>) ſuffered her ſelfe to be drawne to this match, whereof none was more joyfull then <hi>Numerian,</hi> in ſo much that it is hard to expreſſe the contentment he tooke, being as it were, in extaſie, or tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſpirit.</p>

                     <p>The young Duke honoured this marriage with ſuch pompe, and magnificence, that he could not have expended more liberally at the marriage of

                     <p>Not long after <hi>Sapor</hi> wedded a young Princeſſe of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and at this wedding, did <hi>Roſana</hi> (among the joyes ſhe had to ſee her Prince ſo highly match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) make her grace and ability appeare, in the Maskes, Turnaments, and other things, which Knights did, to honour this feaſt, ſhe bore away many prizes, which wonne her great praiſe, yea without envy of her competitors, who admired the good carriage, and dexterity of this Amazon: But the richeſt Iewell that ſhe then wonne was the heart of the young Princeſſe, who tooke ſuch an affection unto her, that ſhe ſeemed to diſpute the preheminence thereof with her husband, thus doth vertue purchaſe eſtimation whereſoever it comes, and in this manner doth it draw hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Numerian</hi> ſeeing this, ſtooped downe his head, and runnes himſelfe into the middeſt of them, and labours to doe ſome good office for that deare halfe of himſelfe, who had done ſo much for <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por,</hi> and as one more carefull of hers then of his owne life, he conjured her affectionately to retire, under the ſafeguard which he yeelded thereto by his reſiſtance.</p>

I have behaved my ſelfe toward him with all the ſubmiſſion, modeſty, and fidelity, which a wife owes unto her husband, but in fine cruell death hath taken him from me, and parted us, and he hath left me in an age not yet ſo great, that it ſhould freeze the blood in my veines, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict me to thinke of a ſecond marriage; I have done all that I can to put this idle fantaſie out of my head, but my nature is ſo repugnant unto this holy vertue of continency, which heaven doth not grant to every one, that I beleeve I ought rather to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then to burne; and that is the thing I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to doe: but becauſe I am not of a common condition, matches conformable to my birth and quality, are not eaſily found; therefore I have caſt mine eyes, and fixed my heart on a Gentleman, with whom I hope to have more contentment then if he were of greater degree; and whoſe alliance will be leſſe prejudiciall unto you, then if I tooke another of higher birth: I know the lawes of the Nobility of this Countrey very well, but I know alſo, that the lawes of nature are more ancient, and thoſe of love more ſtrong, you know what great
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7827:36"/> revenewes I have brought to this houſe, which if it were transſported into the hands of another hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, your inheritance would be much diminiſhed, I have found a way with which I ſhall reſt well contented, our honour ſhall be ſheltered, and your meanes ſhall not be leſſened, nor impoveriſhed: I will ſecretly marry this Gentleman, whom I ſhall name unto you, he ſhall dwell in my houſe as a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall ſervant, none ſhall know that I have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matcht my ſelfe; and if any children ſhall iſſue from him, and me, they ſhall be brought up ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and they may be provided for with indifferent meanes. In this manner without any prejudice to you, I ſhall be ſatisfied. I ſpeake freely, and round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to you, as to my children, from whom I hope for as much love, reſpect, and conſent, as the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your nature doth promiſe me: another, it may be, more haughty and more imperious would have done whatſoever her paſſion had dictated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, without your counſell, and it may be alſo that another having leſſe feare of God, and leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to honour, would have remedied her incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency by meanes, as diſhonourable, as unlawfull: but I had rather dye a thouſand deaths, then to ſet ſuch a ſpot on my blood, and poſterity, knowing this that a woman without honeſty, of what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſoever ſhe be, is but as it were a laiſtall; finally I doe intreate you not to ſpeake any thing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me from this my reſolution, being I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto you, that it is abſolutely neceſſary for my contentment, only judge whether the way by me propoſed be not reaſonable, and fitting, as well

                        <hi>Chriſolite</hi> ſaw that theſe were not ſo much words of complement, as of ſincere verity, weeping with joy, and tenderneſſe, and bleſſing the wit, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of her children, thanked them with great ſignes of acknowledgement, and having diſcovered unto them her affection to <hi>Fleuriall,</hi> and that it was hee that ſhe intended to have, not long after ſhee made him the Steward of her houſe, and having privately married him, none being preſent but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her children, <hi>Leuffroy,</hi> and ſome of her Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women; this young Gentleman in ſtead of being puffed up with pride by his match, behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with ſo much humility, and moderation, as well towards the Counteſſe, as towards her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that both the one, and the other ſtrove who ſhould love him moſt.</p>
                     <p>There were two daughters borne in this ſecond marriage, who were brought up ſecretly; the firſt wherof, and eldeſt was named <hi>Margarite,</hi> the other named <hi>Lucide,</hi> who ſome few yeeres after the death of <hi>Chriſolite</hi> was honourably married, ſhe inherited the wealth, wherewith the Counteſſe and her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer children honoured the fidelity of <hi>Fleuriall,</hi> who even after the death of <hi>Chriſolite</hi> remained with <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Rhinegrave governing all his houſe.</p>

                     <p>The good Marchant more attentive in the care of his affaires then the demeanure of his diſloyall wife, either did not ſee, or at leaſt would not ſeeme to ſee theſe diſorders.

                     <p>Then they faſtned this poore naked body to the foure poſts of the bed, as one extended upon the wheele, and <hi>Anaclete</hi> taking an iron curry combe, which he had cauſed to be made with long teeth, began to curry this gallant, ſo furiouſly, that hee flaid him alive, tearing away his noſe, eyes, and all that made him a man, in briefe leaving no parcell of his skinne untoucht, he ſtretches his good wife on the ſame racke, and curryed her in the ſame manner, caſting their miſerable bodyes on the floore, which had neither face, nor skinne, and left them there panting, and wallowing in their blood, this exploit of cruell vengeance thus acted, he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe into a place of ſafety.</p>
                     <p>Day being come the Magiſtrates enter the houſe where they behold this horrible ſpectacle. Theſe unfortunate creatures lived a while after to confeſſe their faults, and aske God forgiveneſſe for them.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7827:43"/> 
                        <hi>Opile</hi> dyed before night, the woman lived untill the next day, both in torments, which can hardly be imagined. The lawes forgave <hi>Anaclete</hi> this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but becauſe of the cruelty of the action, he was conſtrained wholly to forſake the City, and to change his dwelling, ever ſince it hath remained, as a proverbe in that place when they ſee any one courting another mans wife, they bid him take heed of the curry-combe.</p>
                     <p>Certainly they are quite voyde of humanity, who deteſt not the cruelty of this revenge, more worthy to be abhorred then imitated, and beſides thoſe lawes, which permits husbands to kill the adulterers when they ſurprize them, are contrary unto the lawes divine; nevertheleſſe they were ſtoned to death in the ancient law, providing that it were done in the way of publicke juſtice, and by the ordinary courſe.</p>
                     <p>But who doth not ſee in this hiſtory the juſt judgement of God on the inſolence of this ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and this diſhoneſt woman. The puniſhment of a fault ſeemes the greater, yea redoubled, when as it is either ſhamefull, or ridiculous. And amongſt delinquents whom juſtice ſends to execution, there are many that grieve more to ſuffer by the hands of the hangman, and to ſerve for a ſpectacle to the people, then for the loſſe of their life. If thoſe, who defile themſelves by adultery, had ſuch curriers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, they would not neigh (for to ſpeak with the Scripture) as Stalions after their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours wives.</p>

They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtrip him of his bad cloathes, and put him on a very fine, and cleane ſhirt, in ſtead of his own, which was foule and filthy, they let him ſleepe in that place at his eaſe, and whileſt hee ſettles his drinke, the Duke prepares the pleaſanteſt paſtime that can be imagined.</p>
                     <p>In the morning this drunkard being awake, drawes the curtaines of this brave rich bed, ſees himſelfe in a chamber adorned like a Paradice, he conſiders the rich furnitvre with an amazement ſuch as you may imagine, he beleeves not his eyes but layes his fingers on them, and feeling them open, yet perſwades himſelfe they are ſhut by ſleep, and that all that he ſees is but a pure dreame.</p>
                     <p>Aſſoone as he was knowne to be awake, in comes the officers of the Dukes houſe, who were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Duke what they ſhould do, there were pages bravely apparelled Gentlemen of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Gentleman waiters, and the High Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, who all in faire order, and without laughing bring cloathing for this new gueſt, they honour him with the ſame great reverences, as if hee were a Soveraigne Prince, they ſerve him bare-headed, and aske him what ſuite hee will pleaſe to weare that day.</p>
                     <p>This fellow affrighted at the firſt, beleeving theſe things to be inchantment, or dreames, reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by theſe ſubmiſſions, tooke heart, and grew bold, and ſetting a good face on the matter, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt all the apparell that they preſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

This done, the greateſt Nobleman in the Dukes Court enters the chamber with the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenee, and honour to him, as if he had been their Soveraigne Prince; (<hi>Phillip</hi> with Princely delight beholds this play from a private place) divers of purpoſe petitioning him for pardons, which hee grants with ſuch a countenance, and gravity, as if he had had a Crowne on his head all his life time.</p>
                     <p>Being riſen late, and dinner time approaching, they asked him if he were pleaſed to have the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles covered, he likes that very well; the table is furniſhed, where he is ſet alone, and under a rich Canopie he eates with the ſame ceremony, which was obſerved at the Dukes meales, he made good cheere, and chawed with all his teeth, but only drank with more moderation, then he could have wiſht, but the Majeſty which he repreſented made him refraine.</p>
                     <p>All taken away, he was entertained with new, and pleaſant things, they led him to walke about the great Chambers, Galleries, and Gardens of the Pallace (for all this merriment was played within the gates they being ſhut only for recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Duke, and the principall of his Court) they ſhewed him all the richeſt, and moſt pleaſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt things therein, and talked to him thereof, as if

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7827:46"/> they ſerve him with very ſtrong wine, good <hi>Hipocras</hi> which hee ſwallowed downe in great draughts, and frequently redoubled, ſo that char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſo many extraordinaryes, he yeelded to deaths couſin german ſleep, which cloſed his eyes, ſtopt his eares, and made him looſe the uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and all his other ſences.</p>
                     <p>Then the right Duke, who had put himſelfe among the throng of his Officers, to have the pleaſure of this mummery, commanded that this ſleeping man ſhould bee ſtript out of his brave cloathes, and cloathed againe in his old ragges, and ſo ſleeping carried, and layd in the ſame place, where he was taken vp the night before, this was preſently done, and there did he ſnort all the night long, not taking any hurt either by the hardneſſe of the ſtones, or the night ayre, ſo well was his ſtomacke filled with good preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives.</p>
                     <p>Being awakened in the morning by ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, or it may bee by ſome, that the good Duke <hi>Philip</hi> had thereto appointed: ha, ſaid he, my friends, what have you done? you have rob'd mee of a Kingdome, and have taken mee out of the ſweeteſt, and happieſt dreame, that ever man could have fallen into, then very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring all the particulars of what had paſſed the day before, hee related unto them from point to point, all that had happened unto him, ſtill thinking it aſſuredly to bee a dreame, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to his houſe, hee entertaines his wife, neighbours, and friends with this his

                     <p>The Duke uſed ſome liberality towards him for to helpe him in the poverty of his family, and taking an occaſion thereon to make an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto his Courtiers concerning the vanity of this worlds honours, hee told them, that all, that ambitious perſons ſeeke with ſo much induſtry, is but ſmoake, and a meere dreame, and that they are ſtrucken with that pleaſant folly of the <hi>Athenian</hi> who imagined all the riches, that arrived by ſhipping in the haven of <hi>Athens</hi> to be his, and that all the Marchants were but his Factors: his friends getting him cured by a skilfull Phyſitian of the debility of his brain, in liew of giving them thanks for this good office, he reviled them, ſaying that whereas he was rich in conceit, they had by this cure made him poore, and miſerable in effect.</p>

                     <p>During the long winters nights, ſhee ſpent the beſt part of the evening with the three daughters of <hi>Soſtene,</hi> which, with two ſonnes he had by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wife, the good old man ſitting in the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney corner in his furred gowne, tooke great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in hearing the tales that theſe wenches told, whileſt they were at their worke, and the ſongs which they ſung, and other ſuch pleaſantneſſe, yet all within the limits of honeſty, and vertue, but in all theſe things, as well, as in the workes <hi>Eufronie</hi> excelled, and was as <hi>Diana</hi> amongſt her nimphs. By degrees (for fire requires time to melt ice, and then to make the water boyle which comes of it) the actions, the countenance, the ſpeeches of <hi>Eufronie</hi> delighted him, the features likewiſe of her face, her ſmiles, her lookes, and her other graces imprinted themſelves on his heart, ſo that hee deſired ſhee

                     <p>In fine (not to inſiſt too long on this old mans do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage) after ſome few dayes, himſelfe having hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his wound, and found the ſhaft entred ſo deepe into his heart, that he could not poſſibly get it out, he reſolves with him ſelfe to ſeeke the remedy in the ſubject of his ſmart, and attempt this <hi>Danaes</hi> Tower by <hi>Iupiters</hi> golden ſhower: had his thought aimed at mariage, although Hymen were out of ſeaſon for him, yet had there beene cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to juſtifie his deſigne, and perhaps ſo many diſorders might not have happened thereby, but God Almighty by his juſt judgement permitted him to fall into the ſnares, which he prepared to intrap the honeſtie of <hi>Eufronie.</hi> To tell you in what manner he declared to her the torment he ſuffered for her ſake, and the repugnancies he endured in revealing unto her his ſhamefull pretentions, are things which I know not, and if I did know them, yet I ſhould be loath to foule my paper with ſuch filthy proceedings.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7827:50"/> ſhe carried the matter very wiſely, and warily, advertiſing her brothers of the paſſion that this old man had diſcovered unto her, intreating them to invent ſome ſpeciall pretence thereby to keepe her any more from going to that houſe, where her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence did but only caſt oyle into a fire which could not be quenched but with her abſence.</p>

                        <hi>Tibere,</hi> and <hi>Willerme</hi> tooke another way all that their ſiſter had ſaid, and ſubtile, and crafty as they were thought this a good occaſion well to advance their ſiſter, and their owne affaires. They therefore firſt commended her for imparting unto them what had paſſed, and withall told her that they were not willing, that ſhe ſhould abſent her ſelfe therby to quench this fire, but rather to augment it by her preſence, and change it into a lawfull deſire of marriage, a thing as they ſhewed her might eaſily be done, if ſhe could guide this her deſigne with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
                     <p>She who totally relyed on her brothers, whom ſhe knew wiſhed nothing ſo much as her good, and beſides (a naturall thing) being deſirous of her own advancement, and giving credence unto their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, behaved her ſelfe ſo diſcreetly towards <hi>Soſtene,</hi> that ſhe reduced his flame to ſuch a period, as it could not long endure without poſſeſſing her: nothing cauſes ſo much love as honeſty, wherby ſhe wholly conquered him, letting him know, that ſhee made more account of her honour, then of all the large proffers, that he made her, yea or of all the wealth in the world, and that the only meanes to win her was to marry her, where unto ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

                     <p>Then did he in the houſe of <hi>Eufrony</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of her brothers, and ſome others of their kindred take her for his wife, and received the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall bleſſing, which put him in poſſeſſion of that he had ſo much deſired, to his no ſmall joy, but when

                     <p>This made them as melancholy, and diſcontent, as the brothers of <hi>Eufrony</hi> were glad in ſeeing their counſell take ſo good, and happy effect, whereby they were become brothers in law in the houſe of <hi>Soſtene,</hi> from whence they drew great helpes in their neceſſities, which the more augmented the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, and jealouſie of his children, and bred in them a deſperate rage. <hi>Taddee,</hi> and <hi>Androgeo</hi> ſonnes of <hi>Soſtene,</hi> being of opinion that theſe perſons tooke,

And that glory is a perfume fit to ſmoake no where but before the Altar of vertue, and indeed doe but marke what cleere luſtre, and bright ſparkling you ſee in a Diamond, or what light comes from a great fire, the ſame is honour in vertuous actions, which are of themſelves ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent, that they produce rayes of eſteeme, and

The Pſalmiſt goes further, and will not only have glory to accompany the juſt man, but alſo riches to enter into his houſe, and to remaine there, from age, to age in his poſterity; ſo that if the ancients had had any knowledge of this doctrin, they would ſurely have added a third Temple unto the two former, which they would have dedicated unto good hap, or good fortune, which ſhould have beene entred through that of honour, for there is no doubt to be made but that felicity doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, as a ſhaddow, follow the ſolide body of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and honeſty; ſince that to be vertuous, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable is the higheſt point of felicity, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an honeſt man can aſpire: and although vertue be unto it ſelfe a more then ſufficient recompence, he being unworthy thereof that ſeeks rewards for it, any where but in it ſelfe, for the greateſt price of vertuous actions is to have done them; yet ſo it is that acceſſarily, ſooner, or later, either in this world, or in the next, the acknowledgement ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cannot faile, for Gods goodneſſe, and juſtice is ſuch, that he will render every man according to his workes.

He had beene married, but his wife dyed in childbed having lived with him but three, or foure yeeres, and had left him but one ſonne for a pledge of their love: living in this his widdowhood as a man that aſpired to other nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, and who would not ſpend the reſt of his daies in melancholy, no wonder if he were aſſaulted by thoſe ſoft temptations: whileſt he expected for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to offer him a ſecond match, like unto that which death had taken from him, and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his eſtate and birth. In this eaſe and idleneſſe of life gorged with wealth, he was hit (as the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant of <hi>Antiochus</hi>) in that part of him which was weakeſt.</p>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7827:77"/> to the Aphoriſme) be moſt eaſily conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into choller, and as oyle feeds the fire which is quenched by other liquors, ſo her ſweet admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made him more chollerick, and the gentler he was handled, the worſe did he ſting. Patience lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this woman, whoſe head was troubled with a juſt jealouſie, ſhe fell to reproaches, and threates, which more vexed her froward husband, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with ſharpe words ſeconded with ſuch heavy blowes, that the poore woman was halfe brained thereby. This harſh uſage made her complaine to her parents, who made their moane unto the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, he finding himſelfe obliged to redreſſe this diſorder, cauſed the Chirurgion to be cited before him, and ratled him with ſo good a leſſon, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cauſed him to pay ſuch a fine, that he amended him, if not in effect, yet at leaſt in ſhew, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him on paine of impriſonment to leave of his accuſtomed haunting of ſuch ſuſpitious houſes, where if ever hee were knowne, to goe againe, hee would cauſe him to bee puniſhed as an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer.</p>
                     <p>Here now becomes the ſinner humbled, and he who rejoyced in his evill, and gloryed in his fault, endeavoured to hide his diſſoluteneſſe, to avoyde ſcandall, murmur, and the puniſhment wherewith the Iudge threatned him; yet could he not long abſtaine, for ſince the wicked hath caſt downe his eyes from beholding heaven, and is fallen to the very bottome of the Abyſſus, he deſpiſeth all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane advertiſements, having played bankrout with his ſalvation, but now he finds other tricks, he makes
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7827:78"/> his journeyes by night, and by ſtealth. And to his jealous wife, who had over him as many eyes as <hi>Argus,</hi> he finds out thouſands of lyes. And like another <hi>Mercury</hi> pipes her aſleep, with a flattering tongue, and counterfeit kindneſſes; nevertheleſſe ſhe ſtill miſtruſts him, knowing that as the <hi>Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> cannot leave his blackneſſe, nor a Leopard the ſpots of his skin, howſoever they are waſhed, ſo it is likewiſe hard for him that hath taken a habit of evill to leave of his vitious cuſtomes.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon ſhe ſets divers ſpies, but the malicious man multiplies his deceits, and findes more inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to caſt himſelfe away, then his good carefull wife hath to ſaue him, yea he ſo jnduſtriouſly doth hide his naughtines, that although he minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, yet his neighbours thinke him to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and if his wife complaine, they mocke her ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitions, and accuſe her of cauſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>At length having gathered together his affections &amp; rather having ſetled his infections on a loſt creature whoſe only frequentation had beene ſufficient to defame thoſe that reſorted unto her, being one, that made an infamous trafficke of her ſelfe, he made his hearte, and his body one with this woman. This ſtinking fire could not be kept ſo ſecret, but that it ſhewed it ſelf by it's ſmoke, and blacknes, his wife had already gotten ſome ſmall knowledge of this matter, and already did the neighbours about the place, where he haunted begin to perceiue it, and what veiles ſoever he invented to couer himſelfe withall were meerly as ſpiders webs which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him in covering him.</p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:7827:78"/>
                     <p>One of his moſt probable excuſes was to frame ſome journeyes out of towne, whereupon get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon a Mule which he kept he would ride forth of the City, &amp; come late in the night unto the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe whom he frequented, this craft being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, by continuance, his wife reproved him for it, and threatned to certifie the Iudge that he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his lewd courſes, to the end that feare of puniſhment might cauſe him to refraine, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether obſtinate in his vice, and as it were fallen into a reprobate ſenſe, jeſted at her admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and with blaſphemous oathes, and horrible imprecations laboured to cover his fault, as if adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery (ſaith that ancient Lawyer) could be purged by oath: but heaven doth not alwayes laugh at the perjuries of thoſe, that are blinded with the fooliſh paſſion which they call love, but when the meaſure of a ſinners iniquities is come to it's full heape, the arme of the moſt high turnes downe on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and makes him feele the weight thereof, by puniſhments no leſſe ſtrange then terrible.</p>
                     <p>This man being arrived at the full period of his abhominations, and his fault drawing along with it it's inſeparable ſhadow puniſhment, got on evening upon his Mule, ſaying, as he had often before done, that he was riding forth of towne about a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant cure, his wife who miſdoubted the ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme, asked him where it was that he was going, thy jealouſly (ſaid he) that puts a thouſand ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering ſuſpitions into thy head, makes thee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that I am now going to ſome lewd place; but thinke whatſoever thou wilt, I will be my owne
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7827:79"/> maſter, and free as I liſt, neither will I give any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy account of mine actions.</p>
                     <p>His wife knew by theſe ſpeeches that he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the place wherunto his unjuſt concupiſcence drew him, for even as ulcerated bodies will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be touched to the quicke, ſo likewiſe will guilty minds be netled, and moved unto anger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reprehended for their faults: well ſhe proceeds in her exclamations, railes, &amp; threatens him, he who had hardned himſelfe in malice, diſputing with this furious woman, rendred her word for word, threat forthreat, &amp; at laſt ſaid unto her, if thy curioſity muſt needs be ſatisfied: know then, that in deſpight of thee, and of thy railing I am going to a bawdy houſe.</p>
                     <p>With theſe words he leapes upon his Mule, and ſpurring him hard to get from the bawling wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who began to raiſe a rumour about her gate by the complaints which ſhe made unto her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. This Mule being ſomething untoward fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelfe extraordinarily preſt by the ſpurre, began to kicke, fling, and leape, with ſuch violence that he caſt his maſter from his backe, whoſe foote hanging in one of his ſtirrups, and the Mule ſetting himſelfe to run with all his force drag'd this adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer in ſuch a manner on the ſtones, that his head ſhattered into many pieces, and his braines lay in the ſtreets, this humorous beaſt ſtayed not till ſhee came before the doore of that infamous houſe, whereunto he had ſo unluckily ſaid he was going, and where his accuſtomed haunt was, there did the Mule ſtay with his unfortunate maſter who ſtarke
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7827:79"/> dead, and much broken remained there a long on the ground. Thus through divine permiſſion by the death of this miſerable man was diſcovered the commerce, which when he was living, he had kept ſo ſecret, and thus was preached on the houſe tops what he had committed in a cloſe chamber, ſo was verified what the holy Scripture teacheth us, that all creatures which breath on the face of the earth fight for Gods juſtice againſt thoſe ſenceleſſe perſons, that violate his law, and ſtray from his wayes.</p>
                     <p>Preſently this was bruited all over that part, where this horrid ſpectacle was, and ſo farre were any from bewayling this diſaſter, that contrariwiſe every one adored and praiſed the Almighties ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in his chaſticement, according to that of the Prophet, that he will make abundant retribution unto the proud, and that good people rejoycing to ſee his vengeance, ſhall waſh their hands in the bloud of the ſinner.</p>

                     <p>When as Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift ſate in the chaire of <hi>Rome, Italy</hi> was found ſo full of theeves, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which there they call Bandits, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce was much hindred thereby, becauſe none might travell ſafely, nor ſcarce be in the country without danger, for thoſe villaines aſſembling in troopes, kept the high wayes, robbing the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and without mercy killing thoſe that made any reſiſtance.

The Princes who ſaw the diſſolution of their States to approach very neere, if ſome ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy remedy were not found, began to conſult to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the taking of theſe people; at length they reſolved to put armes into the Commons

                     <p>Hereupon a grave and wiſe politician gave this counſell, which at firſt was thought ſomething ſtrange, but experience ſhewed it to be profitable: and this was to ſet a price upon the heads of theſe cut-throates, and to promiſe impunity and generall pardon to thoſe, that ſhould bring them either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live or dead before the Princes: this put ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and miſtruſt among thoſe raſcalls, that they were in continuall ſuſpition each of other, which brake that intelligence, wherein conſiſted their greateſt ſtrength: And as God in times paſt for to deſtroy the <hi>Madianites</hi> made uſe only of their own hands, for theſe villaines daily kild one another, ſome to get their repeale from baniſhment, others to have the reward propoſed unto thoſe that ſhould bring the head of a Bandite: now amongſt the moſt reſoluteſt, and boldeſt trickes, which are related therof here is one execrable indeed in it's execution, yet with a remarkable ſtratagem, wherin the hand of God is ſeen to accompany the wicked.

And thus was he, as it were, made inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent by heaping many horrible faults one upon another.

For not long after as this bloudy author of ſo many murders proud of his impunity walked, not at all repenting, but boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his wickednes, and making a glory of his confuſion, the Marchant who knew him againe grieving for his loſſe, ſeconded by ſome friend, ſet upon him ſo fiercely, that after hee had received ſome wounds, he was forced to ſeeke his ſafety by flight, and by the juſt judgement of God, by his

Now, the firſt of theſe appearing not, to wit; that he ran into debt, the ſecond was believed to the great decay of his birthes glory, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his reputation: Idlenes as all men know, is the nurſerie of all vices; play is the occupation of idle perſons, and as the ſpring from whence are drawen divers bad channells: money is the nerves and ſinewes of wickednes as well as of war; now as <hi>Venus</hi> is cold without <hi>Ceres &amp; Bacchus,</hi> ſo without the helpe of <hi>Pluto,</hi> who is the God of that mettall, which the avarice of mortalls hath pluckt out of the Earths bowells, riot cannot laſt; but what veine of gold would not be drained dry by prodigalitie, ſince it is a bottomleſſe gulfe: truly unto thoſe that be very fortunate in play, gameing ſerves as a ſpring, to uphold their great expences. But where are theſe children of good fortune, who feele not ſomtimes her turnings and croſſings and by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in playing, finde not that cardes and dice are more uncertaine, then Armes?

Truely ſhee is a ſtrong woman, whoſe price ought to bee ſought for unto the fartheſt and extremeſt parts of the earth, if there be any price worthy of a chaſt ſoule, which the Wiſeman ſetteth above all eſteeme. <hi>Zotique</hi> no leſſe ſtung by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, than by the beauty of this <hi>Caſtule,</hi> after he had felt the rages that evill love is wont to breed in the ſoules which it poſſeſſeth, in fine changed this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure flame into one more holy, but not leſſe vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the diſhoneſt illuſions that had troubled his imagination, ſeparated themſelves from his minde, and ſeeing that hee could have no acceſſe unto the poſſeſſion of <hi>Caſtule,</hi> but by way of matrimony, he reſolved to preferre vertue before nobility and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſeeing that Nobility is but a ray or beame, or rather a reward of vertue, and riches are her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.

Truſt me Sir, I will ſay nothing againſt the vertue of the beauty, nor againſt the beauty of the vertue of this wiſe maid, for that were the way wilfully to offend truth, and wrong your judgment, which would not have made choice of that miſtreſſe to ſettle your affection upon, if you had not found qualities fitting.

                        <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> was very glad to be rid of ſerving a bad matter, but when he went to take his leave of <hi>Zotiques</hi> Father for to retire himſelfe home unto his owne, the Lord of <hi>Fleuranval</hi> who had put him to his ſonne and knew his deſerts, retained him to waite on himſelfe in his Chamber: this Father had already ſmelt ſomthing of his ſonnes paſſion for <hi>Caſtule,</hi> which much troubled his braine, intending not that by any meanes his blood ſhould be mixt with the blood of a Contrey Wench ſuch as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtule</hi> was eſteemed to be, and therefore was he very glad to retaine <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> to penetrate further into the matter by his inſtructions, but he behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe reſervedly and with ſo much Prudence, that no whit exaſperating the Father aginſt the ſonne, he ſatiſfied the curioſity of the one without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the other: meane time he continues his honeſt intelligence with <hi>Caſtule,</hi> and advertiſing her of the enterpriſes of his Maſters ſonne he gave her meanes to avoide them? <hi>Zotique</hi> whoſe fire was come to the laſt degree of it's violence, ſtrives by extreme meanes to attaine unto his pretentions, he who daily cheated in gaming, made no greate

And although <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> aſſure the contrary, yet his mind pre-occupated by a good forecaſt, ſince it is not the part of a wiſe man to ſay I had not thought, he deals with the Magiſtrates, and drawes them to forbid <hi>Caſtule</hi> to pretend any thing in the marriage of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,</hi> nor to ſuffer his ſuit unto her. No ſooner comes this ſentence to the knowledge of this maid, but ſhe proteſts to wiſh for nothing of <hi>Zotique,</hi> but to be delivered from his importunate purſuits, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaing that this act of juſtice may be ſignified unto him, to the end hee might refraine his inſolent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

For the reverence due to the Magiſtrate, ſhe renounceth, <hi>viva voce,</hi> and by writing, all claim or pretence to this marriage, whereof through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility ſhe declares her ſelfe unworthy. Although that if vertue were eſteemed according to its worth, ſhe deſerved a better match. <hi>Zotique</hi> hath likewiſe his ſhare in this ſentence, whereat hee ſcoffes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordinary cuſtom of youth and nobility; chiefely of great ones, who laugh at the formalities of juſtice, knowing that lawes are but ſpider-webs, which ſtay but the ſmalleſt flies, and are rent by the big ones. Contrariwiſe, as there is nothing that ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the minde like contradiction, nor that provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth deſire ſo much as forbidding, this ſentence was
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7827:98"/> as oyle on the fire, and glorying in his ſhame, I mean his rebellion to the magiſtrate, and diſobedience to his father, he leaves no meanes unattempted, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the end of his pretenſions, and ſtill talkes of mariage, as being a fair and lawful gate to paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row unto his deſigne.</p>
                     <p>The father ſeeing this madneſſe poſſeſſe the ſoul of his ſonne, caſts the cauſe thereof on the charmes of <hi>Caſtule,</hi> publiſhing that ſhe hath inchanted him; and indeed if he had taken beauty and vertue for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, hee had had the more reaſon to thinke ſo, ſeeing there is nothing which ſo much charmeth ſoules: but hee takes it in an ill way, and ſayes that ſhe deales in magick, ſo little doth he know the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and ſimplicity of this maid. Meane time, as there is no wound ſo ſlight but ſerveth for exerciſe unto ſurgeons, ſo there is no pretext ſo weake, but may yeeld great imployment to magiſtrates and officers. The Lord <hi>Fleurenvall</hi> by right of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood was very familiarly acquainted with the Lord of the place where <hi>Caſtule</hi> made her aboad, he makes him become ſuſceptible of his opinion, and partaker in his cauſe: <hi>Caſtule</hi> is taken, and without being heard, or any other manner of proceeding, is caſt into priſon.

But iron is never cleaner than when it comes out of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, nor brighter than when it hath been under the ſharp teeth of the file, the ſun never ſhines clearer, than when it comes from under a cloud, the coale that hath beene covered with aſhes is thereby hotter and quicker: Although innocency be ſhaded in the obſcurity of priſons, yet nevertheleſſe ſhe comes out in triumph, radiating with glory. All the fault of <hi>Caſtule</hi> was in the falſe opinion of the Lord of <hi>Fleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renval:</hi> notwithſtanding her impriſonment is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly cenſured by the judgements of the world, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one hath liberty to ſpeake his minde thereof, but it touched <hi>Zotique</hi> and <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> to the quicke, yet very differently, and truely the difference muſt be drawne out of the varietie or rather contrarietie of their affection, and the more that of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> was ſincere and honeſt, the more ſmarting ought to be his paine; nevertheleſſe hee repreſſes it in his heart, and veiles it with a modeſt ſilence, which makes it the ſharper, in the ſame manner as fire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubles its heate, beeing reſtrained within a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace.

Whileſt <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> covertly ſollicites the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Caſtule,</hi> and that the judge who had ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decreed her impriſonment, findes no witneſſe in the information, which accuſe her ſo much as of the ſhadow of this blacke diabolicall crime of magick, whereof ſhe is accuſed by the author of her impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, he ſayes openly he will ſet her at libertie, and in effect preferring the diſcharge of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, before the favour of his Lord, hee ſignes her inlargement: but the bird is taken, and the keyes of the cage being in the hands of the maſter of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, ſhe is retained by force. Whereunto <hi>Zotique</hi> is reſolved to oppoſe his ſtrength, ſince it is permitted by all lawes, to repulſe one violence by another. Whileſt he prepares himſelfe to this project, <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius,</hi> whoſe eye was every where, watches ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, that he diſcovers an evill plot by a ſtinking match; <hi>Zotique</hi> under the cloake of juſtice wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an execrable act, he reſolves to draw this maid out of priſon, with the aſſiſtance of the Provoſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, and works ſo wel with ſome of his archers, that they promiſe to put her into his power, as ſoone as they had gotten her out. You may imagine, if in that heate which conſumed him, he would not have gathered by faire meanes or foule, that which he ſo impatiently deſired.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> ſeeing that this ſtroke tended to the ruine of her whom hee held ſo deare, and being not able to oppoſe it by force, ſought by prudence to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7827:100"/> put it backe, hee goes ſtraight to the Provoſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall, who had no part in this pernicious project, and having prayed him to contribute his power to the deliverance of this innocent priſoner, hee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conjures him not to take her out of one miſery and leave her in a greater, and deſires him to bee as much protector of her honeſty, as of her innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: which the Provoſt promiſed him on his honor, and effected it as an officer ſhould doe that acquits himſelf worthy of his charge. Nevertheleſſe it was not without difficulty, becauſe that the Lord who retained <hi>Caſtule</hi> in the priſon of his caſtle, would not ſuffer the viſit of a Provoſt therein: yet on the other ſide he feared to become guilty by ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a rebellion againſt juſtice, to avoid the one and the other, he reſolved to deliver her up willingly at the gate of his houſe, but it was there where the Provoſt had ſomething to doe, for to combat the diſloyalty of his owne followers, who had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deliver this prey into the hands of <hi>Zotique,</hi> from whom they had received gifts: but the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of innocence and purity ſent his helpe in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, becauſe that the number of the Catchpoles which were free from this combination, were found to be greater than thoſe that were corrupted, they could not performe their wicked promiſe.</p>
                     <p>The Provoſt put this maid ſafe into the hands of her father, who was a husbandman: but the poore man fearing the plots and violence of <hi>Zotique,</hi> had by the counſell of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> entreated a great Lady therabouts to take his daughter into her protection. This was the ſacred ſanctuary where this Virgine
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7827:100"/> ſheltred her ſelf, experiencing the truth of this, that he who hopes in the helpe of our Lord ſhall finde an aſſured protection, and a city of refuge, hee will deliver him from the hunters ſnares, and will hide him under the ſhadow of his wings; his truth ſhall cover him as a buckler, and plagues ſhal not approch his dwelling.</p>
                     <p>Now doth <hi>Zotiques</hi> fury turne into madneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that having no more acceſſe unto <hi>Caſtule,</hi> nor hope to ſee her, much leſſe to get her into his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he knowes not what remedies to apply unto his ſmarting burnes: We muſt confeſſe, that when paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion begins to loſe hope, it cauſes ſtrong convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the minde; This man forgets the reſpect hee ought to beare unto that honourable Lady in whoſe houſe <hi>Caſtule</hi> had ſheltred her ſelf, and threatens to put her houſe and all to fire and ſword, if he be not permitted to ſee and converſe with this maid. The Lady complaines to the Lord of Fleurenval, of his ſonnes inſolencie. The father, whoſe ſeverity was ſufficiently knowne, promiſes her to take ſuch order with him, as ſhe ſhould have cauſe to be contented, and to reſt free from feare. He arreſts <hi>Zotique</hi> and impriſons him in one of the chambers of his Caſtle: It was there where this fond young man had time to digeſt his liquor, as the ſaying is, and to take up<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on him other exerciſes than of play, women, and feaſts; he found his father to be rough, a gameſter that his cheating trickes auailed nothing againſt him; in lieu of his converſation amongſt companies to champe on the bridle in a ſolitary place, and in lieu of good cheare he hath but the water of teares,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7827:101"/> &amp; the bread of ſorrow: what repentance ſoever he ſhewed, the fathe rrelinquiſht nothing of his auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, prudently judging that he ſung this ſong only to get out of the cage, and that he wouId ſoon change his note, if he could recover the liberty of the ayre. During this impriſonment, which laſted three or foure months, there hapned unto <hi>Caſtule</hi> a fortune, by ſo much the more admirable, as it was wholly unhoped for.</p>
                     <p>There died in Touraine a certaine gentlewoman whom we will call <hi>Martiniane:</hi> ſhe was ſomething an antient maid, and in full poſſeſſion of all her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, ſhe made her will, and thereby declared, how in her fathers life time ſhe had contracted a ſecret or clandeſtine marriage with a young man of Britany, who though a yonger brother &amp; poore, yet a very compleat gentleman; how by him ſhe had <hi>Caſtule,</hi> whom by a very truſty perſon ſhe had cauſed to be conveyed out of the countrey, and brought up by a husbandman of Pearch; how that her ſaid husband died in Britany: ſhe ſayes alſo, how that ſince the death of her father ſhame had retained her from declaring this truth: and withall, rehearſes all the circumſtances neceſſary for the finding out and knowing this daughter, and declares her her heire; and in default of her leaves all to an hoſpitall. She made executor of this her will a certaine Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of her owne kindred, a man of good life and great authority, who tooke a journey expreſly into Perch, that there with his own, and not with others eyes he might ſeeke out this maid, by the ſignes and tokens given him hee came into the houſe of this
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7827:101"/> good husbandman, who had thitherto beene taken for the father of <hi>Caſtule,</hi> he acknowledged that at ſuch a time ſuch a manner of man had delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a little girle of ſuch an age, cloathed in ſuch a manner, and ſuch markes: and further ſhewed bracelets of gold, with certaine cyphers or chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters on them, and ſaid how he had received a good ſumme of money for the bringing of her up, with promiſe of a greater if hee did preſerve her careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. All this was found conformable to that which <hi>Martiniane</hi> had ſaid on her death bed, and had alſo declared in her will. From thence he went unto the caſtle where then <hi>Caſtule</hi> made her reſidence, and found on her face ſo many features of reſemblance unto thoſe of the deceaſed gentle woman, that hee doubted no more of that truth which ſtrooke into his eyes, he receives her then as his pupill, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving largely rewarded the husbandman who had kept her ſo long, he prepares to leade her into Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, there to take poſſeſſion of the faire inheritance that was befallen, which was held to amount unto the worth of 20000 French crowns. This wonder being divulged, and come to the knowledge of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique</hi> and of his father, it made even then the filme to fall from their eyes, and the one wiſh to have <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtule</hi> for his daughter in law, and the other to deſire her for his wife.</p>
                     <p>But whether it were that this new fortune had puft up the courage of this generous maid, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were that ſhee had a juſt indignation againſt the father, who had cauſed her to be impriſoned as a ſorcereſſe, and againſt the ſon who had ſollicited
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7827:102"/> her with ſo much inſolency, and attempted ſo often and ſo impudently againſt her honour, ſhee would never give eare to this match. Then did <hi>Zotique</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile himſelfe to <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> conjuring him to uſe his beſt meanes, and employ his credit towards <hi>Caſtule</hi> to get her to like of his ſuit. And truly this faithfull ſervant failed no whit in his duty, being as deſirous of <hi>Caſtules</hi> advancement, as of <hi>Zotiques</hi> good, hee laboured to perſwade her to give eare thereunto, alledging the antient nobilitie and great eſtate of the houſe of <hi>Fleurenval,</hi> and beſides all that, the extreame affection of <hi>Zotique</hi> towards her, whereof, ſaid he, ſhe ſhould expect no leſſe than all manner of good uſage: but he was ſo far from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering any thing therein, that <hi>Caſtule</hi> had nothing ſo frequent in her mouth, as the deteſtation of chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and other defects which defamed the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Zotique.</hi> And as <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> found not that as he ſought, he unawares met with that which was not in his thought to ſeeke. For wealth was ſo far from altering the heart of <hi>Caſtule,</hi> or from making her forget the promiſe which ſhee had made, to love him inviolably, that contrariwiſe her colour riſing, and likewiſe her voice, even to a tone which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the true thought of her ſoule, ſhee ſaid unto him, How now <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> what finde you in mee unworthy or unpleaſing ſince fortune ſmiles on me, hath wealth chang'd my face or my maners? do you take the words of a maid for the wagging of a leaf? and will you who have ſo often blamed the falſe oathes of <hi>Zotique,</hi> make me guilty of the like ſinne? are thoſe which I have made unto you of an invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7827:102"/> love vaniſhed out of your memory? why pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileſſe of your ſelfe do you forget your owne cauſe, to embrace that of a traitor, who hath cauſed mee a 1000. harmes? what have I done ſo diſpleaſing to your eies, that Iſhuld now be nothing unto you? tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as far as I ſee, unconſtancy is a blame not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily layd upon the humour of men, ſince it is their nature ſo to be. And will you <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> whoſe faith I eſteemed as a rocke, be in the number of the reſt? as for my part, I am ſtill the ſame for you as I was, the change of my ſtate hath not changed my will, I have ſo deepely ingraven in my ſoule the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſo many notable obligations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſtand indebted to you, that I behold you, not meerely as a man, but as a tutelary Angell ſince you have beene both my liberator and guardian of my integrity, preſerving me from the Ambuſhes and violencies of barbarous <hi>Zotique.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She would have proceeded further when <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius</hi> kneeling downe and taking her by the hand, which he watered with teares, and ſaid with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling voyce, interrupted by feares and ſobs, from whenceſoever this diſcourſe proceeds it is able to kill me ſuddenly with griefe or joy, with the one if it be fained, with the other if it bee true; if it bee the firſt the tryall is very violent, if the ſecond, I confeſſe as weake braines cannot beare much wine, ſo my heart is not ſtrong enough to beare ſo great felicity, the change of your fortune had made looſe my hope of attaining unto your affection, but had not taken from me the inviolable deſire of your

                     <p>But is it poſſible that ſo much conſtancy ſhould bee found in you, and that in ſo great a change of eſtate you have not affected a change, and that wealth hath not altered the integrity of your affections?

Meane time the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe reads her a leſſon of the felicity of marriage, and pleaſures of the world, repreſenting to her the contentment ſhe ſhall have with her brother, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per compleat gentleman, who would honor &amp; love her infinitely: alaſſe what could this young minde have done, toſſed betwixt ſuch different blaſts?</p>
                     <p>This Abbeſſe made her write letters conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto her will, wherby ſhe gave her mother <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla</hi> to underſtand, that ſhe felt her ſelfe no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to a Cloiſteral life, and that ſhe would not take upon her a yoke which ſhe thought her ſelf not able to beare with honour and perſeverance: That a particular vocation was requiſite thereunto, which ſhe felt not in her ſelfe, and that ſhee had rather not vow, than afterwards not to keepe promiſe. Theſe letters, which the Abbeſſe had dictated, ſhe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with letters of her owne, counſelling <hi>Priſcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> to take her daughter into the world again, becauſe ſhe was no way fit for any Order whatſoever, but it were better for her to enter into the ſtate of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.

Mean while the time of taking the Novices Veile approaches, <hi>Priſcilla</hi> requires her daughters finall reſolution; the Abbeſſe anſwers for her, or if ſhe anſwers for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, it is by the organ or direction of the Abbeſſe.</p>
                     <p>In fine one day <hi>Marcionille</hi> far from affection to <hi>Salve,</hi> preſſed by her firſt deſire, and imagining with her ſelfe, that if ſhe remained in that monaſterie, the Abbeſſe whoſe intentions ſhee fruſtrated would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſe her well; on the other ſide foreſeeing, that if ſhe returned into her mothers houſe ſhe ſhould there be ill handled, reſolved to write at large to <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> and to diſcover unto her filially as unto her good mother, the true feeling of her ſoule, and all the turnings and windings of her minde, intreating that if ſhe loved her reſt, ſhe would be pleaſed to put her to be in ſome other monaſtery, diſavowing all the letters which the Abbeſſe had made her write, for to attaine unto the end which ſhe had plotted, which was to make her marry <hi>Salve.</hi> By this letter <hi>Priſcilla</hi> diſcovered that there was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the city, and knew clearly the art that had been uſed to win the mind of her daughter, and to lead her into a deſigne far wide from her intention; ſhe conferres thereof with <hi>Iſidorus</hi> her ſubrogated Gardian, who adviſedly as a man of affaires made a countermine againſt that of the Abbeſſe and <hi>Salve,</hi> to reduce their projects into ſmoake; but in the end both his counſell and <hi>Priſcilla's,</hi> and alſo the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Abbeſſe and <hi>Salve</hi> ſhall be turned top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide-turvy. <hi>Priſcilla</hi> goes to fetch her daughter out of the monaſtery: <hi>Iſidore</hi> adviſed her to ſay that ſhe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7827:108"/> would leade her home to her owne houſe, to ſettle her in the world by ſome good match. But as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men cannot keepe a ſecret, much leſſe forbear ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what is forbidden them to ſay, ſhe could not conceale that they had ſtifled in her daughter the deſire of a ſingle life, but that ſhe could make it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive againe, by putting her into another monaſtery. Hereupon from word to word the Abbeſſe and ſhe began to enter into conteſtation, and at laſt <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla</hi> revealed all the myſterie of <hi>Salve,</hi> and caſt it in the teeth of the Abbes, adding thereunto ſharp &amp; ſtinging words, where with my pen will not blacke this paper. There is now all the cabal diſcovered, &amp; poore <hi>Marcionille</hi> in the greateſt confuſion that can be imagined, ſeeing her ſelfe as it were the butte or mark of the contradiction both of her mothers and the Abbeſſes tongues; this glowing iron of choller is beaten on her back, her griefe may better be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined than deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Salve</hi> being without, and hearing of this jangling, was in extream agonies, ſeeing his plot diſcovered, that he deſpaired of ever being able to upholdit: he bethinks himſelfe, that if the maid once get out of his ſiſters hands, he ſhall no more approach her nor conquer her mind, much leſſe get the good will of her friends, who would looke on him rather as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer than a lover, and for his part hee had nothing but his ſword, and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> nor <hi>Iſidore</hi> are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that will give the one her daughter, the other his pupill, to a yonger brother, whoſe part amounts unto nothing but hope, he findes meanes to ſpeake with his ſiſter, and perſwades her to retaine <hi>Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nille</hi>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:7827:108"/> by faire meanes or by force. The Abbeſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved his counſell, and how loud ſoever <hi>Priſcilla</hi> gaped, yet ſhe was faine for that time to goe backe without her daughter. Preſently ſhe complained to the juſtice, and preſents her petition, ſhewing the violence which is done her. The Abbeſſe anſwers, That contrariwiſe ſhe ſeeks but to hinder violence, that the will of this gentlewoman be not forced, who hath no will to be a Nunne, but only to pleaſe her mother, or for fear of being ill uſed by her: That if ſhe will be ſo, ſhee is ready to receive her accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the agreement made therof; in briefe, not to make here the draught of a law-ſuit, in lieu of tracing an hiſtory, this maid caunot be gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent but by the authority of juſtice, who gave order that ſhe ſhould be put neither into the hands of her mother, nor into any other houſe, but ſequeſtred in the houſe of <hi>Iſidore,</hi> who was both her kinſman, and ſubrogated guardian, to the end that with al liberty and freedome ſhe might there declare what manner of life ſhe would chuſe to leade. Being there bred with much tenderneſſe and ſuavity among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſidore,</hi> there often reſorted a yong man, ſon of a great friend of <hi>Iſidore,</hi> who in regard of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his own proper merit, was there very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: by I know not what encounter of humours, which Philoſophers call ſympathie, there was wrought ſuch a correſpondence betweene him and <hi>Marcionille,</hi> that in ſhort time their love was growne to ſuch a point, as nothing could be added to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but onely conſummation of the marriage.</p>
                     <p>As they went on ſimply in their proceedings, this
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7827:109"/> affection was ſoone perceived by <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to divert <hi>Marcionille</hi> from it: but it had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch root in her mind, that all former thoughts of a Cloyſter were quite baniſhed from thence. <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> advertiſed hereof, and glad to oblige his friend by this match, perſwades <hi>Priſcilla</hi> that it is both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature and reaſon, thus to preſſe ſome Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to caſt themſelves into monaſteries, thereby to enrich the reſt, that ſhe ſhould do far better to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto this marriage, than violently to force the will of her daughter. This mother yeelded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and in few dayes, notwithſtanding the violent paſſions, ſubtill deviſes, and oppoſitions of <hi>Salve, Marcionille</hi> came into the poſſeſſion of <hi>Eugenian,</hi> in whoſe armes ſhe now leads a happy and contented life. Her former deſires of being veiled, were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weake motions, than abſolute wils, inclinations which the perſwaſions of others and the weakneſſe of her age had bred, rather than deſignes framed by a mature and ſetled judgement. Thus the Abbeſſe ſaw her ſelfe fruſtrated of a good bit, <hi>Salve</hi> of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the firſt project of her mother wholly annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which was to make this child a Nunne; the firſt counſell of <hi>Iſidore</hi> was changed, and he who firſt gave it to veile her, gave it likewiſe to marry her. <hi>Eugenian</hi> grew ſo pleaſing to the eldeſt brother of <hi>Marcionille,</hi> that he became better contented to have him for his brother in law, than to enjoy the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his ſiſter.

After a thouſand proteſtations of purity, of intention and honeſt pretention. <hi>Hermile</hi> was permitted by her father to hearken unto <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian,</hi> and not to reject after a froward manner the vowes of his love and ſervice.

Then did <hi>Maximian</hi> judge that his minde would never yeeld, and that thoſe gentle letters which hee had written were but onely lures to call him backe into his countrey, from the object of his paſſion, and cauſe him by abſence to forget her, and indeed this was the intent of <hi>Rogat.</hi> Contrariwiſe <hi>Maximian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes the vowes of loyaltie in his ſoule, and alſo in writing: for not content to write letters unto <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile</hi> by every ordinary meſſenger, hee over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſent her a promiſe or contract of marriage, thereby to tye himſelfe vnto her with ſuch bonds as he ſhould not be able to breake, without loſing the quality of a man of faith and of his word. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keepes him at home, and labours by all meanes to divert him from his love: but as the ſonne cannot
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7827:113"/> winne the Father, much leſſe can the Father alter the will of the Sonne, the one remaines ſtedfaſt in the negative; the other deſtinated in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. <hi>Rogat</hi> judgeth that hee ſhall not be able to draw out this nayle but with another, and that the way to roote this affection out of the heart of <hi>Maximian</hi> is to marry him, matches are not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his neighbour-hood; Daughters are plants which grow but in too great a number, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have greater portions, yet have they not in <hi>Maximians</hi> opinion ſuch graces, neyther in body nor ſoule as <hi>Hermile, Hermile</hi> alone hath firſt poſſeſt his affections, and <hi>Hermile</hi> only and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall poſſeſſe them even unto the grave: the wind puts out ſmall fires, but great ones augment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, abſence and contradiction extinguiſh common ſlight flames, but ſtrong and excellent ones take vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor by time and oppoſition. <hi>Maximian</hi> refuſed all the matches, which were offered him, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to marry, or to have her whom hee deſired.</p>
                     <p>Some Phyſitians ſay, that there is a certaine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe called <hi>Exotique,</hi> otherwiſe Melancholy of love, which ought to bee dealt withall after the manner of the Hyppocondriacks by condeſcending in ſome ſort unto the fantaſies of theſe craized braines, <hi>Rogat</hi> made uſe of this induſtry to heale the ſicke mind of <hi>Maximian</hi> hee found out a young man that could artificially counterfeit all manner of hand writing, then cauſed he a report to be ſpread, that he was upon marrying his ſon <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian,</hi> that all was agreed upon, that the wedding
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7827:114"/> day approached, and made this report fly unto <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile;</hi> and her Father by a ſuborned paſſion, and ſuch ſubtile meanes with ſo much likelihood, that it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their credence for a trueth; then wholy to accompliſh this deceipt he made the fore ſaid yong man dexterouſly to counterfeit the hand of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian,</hi> and in his name write letters to the Father and daughter, whereby he excuſed the breach of his word, and promiſe upon the conſtraint uſed by his Father, who forced him to a match againſt his will, and inclination; and after many proteſtations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and exclamations againſt this violence, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing much ſorrow for the breach of this band of love, ſo often knit by oathes: He leaves <hi>Hermile</hi> at liberty to take her fortune, proteſting that being he could not by any meanes have her for his wife, he would eternally love her as his ſiſter; theſe letters fell ſo patly into the hands of <hi>Hermile</hi> and her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe mindes were preocupated with the newes of <hi>Maximians</hi> marriage, that they made no more doubt of this change, which they attributed to the difficulties and oppoſitions, and with all too inconſtancy ſo naturall in men. The Suitors which <hi>Hermile</hi> had refuſed, for to keep her word with <hi>Maximian,</hi> hearing of this rupture renewed their ſutes amongſt the reſt an ancient Captaine, who had been caught by the eies with the face of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile,</hi> ſhewed himſelfe moſt earneſt and above all made her the moſt advantageous proffers, this wiſe maid who ſaw but through the eies of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let him chooſe for her, &amp; guide the Articles of this Marriage at his pleaſure, being reſolved to

                     <p>The betrothing is deferred untill they heare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from <hi>Maximian</hi> but under other pretences, and how earneſtly ſoever Captaine <hi>Severin</hi> preſt the Maſter, he was ſtill put off with delaies; both Father and Daughter writ at large to <hi>Maximian,</hi> and diſpatch away a man expreſly, who lets him ſee his counterfeit letter, hee cries out on the falſity, and without any more words, reporting that hee intended to ride a hunting, ſteales from his Fathers houſe, and making no other anſwere to his letters, takes poſt to <hi>Paris,</hi> where as ſoone as hee ariveth without any other counſell, but what hee takes of his anger, hee challenges <hi>Severin,</hi> who meetes him at the place appointed, <hi>Hermile</hi> having notice thereof without any regard eyther to her ſex or

                     <p>The father feeling his end approach, conjured his ſonne as much as he could, to caſt off this affection, and to take a match more fitting and advantageous. But <hi>Maximian</hi> who made more account of his word than of all the wealth of the world, would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his love. <hi>Rogat</hi> in deſpight thereof made his will, and inſtituted the younger ſon his heire, in caſe that <hi>Maximian</hi> ſhould ever happen to marry <hi>Hermile.</hi> Hereupon he dies, and <hi>Maximian</hi> as eldeſt takes poſſeſſion of the inheritance: the yonger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes proteſtations conformable to the will, which being examined by the judges was declared void or nullified in that reſpect, as made in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of a marriage, the ſoule whereof was freedom, ſeeing that <hi>Rogat</hi> thereby would extend his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall power unto a time wherein he ſhould no more bee. Then <hi>Maximian</hi> beeing maſter both of his meanes and perſon, went to the Court with a brave traine, where at the age of three and thirty yeares he married <hi>Hermile,</hi> who was two and twenty. All the world extolled his conſtancy and loyalty, and he was held for a rare patterne of love and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. To tell you with how many joyes theſe croſſes were recompenced, and what felicities fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this long attendance, would require the lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp of <hi>Hymens</hi> veile, which were not ſeemely: thoſe unto whom theſe thoughts are not forbidden, may ſtay thereon; whileſt I ſhall obſerve that <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile</hi> hath loſt nothing by her ſtaying, ſince that from a meane condition ſhee ſees her ſelfe raiſed to the degree of a Lady, beloved and cheriſhed by a husband who adores her, and in a wealth far above
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7827:116"/> her hopes: but in truth there are not <hi>Maximians</hi> to be found by dozens, few young men keep their firſt flames ſo conſtantly. Yet on the other ſide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation thereof may bee attributed to the honeſty of <hi>Hermile,</hi> who like a Veſtall could ſo carefully keepe the fire of true love by purity, that it is no wonder if the ſucceſſe thereof hath bin happy, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune being at laſt forced to fall downe at the feet of Vertue, whoſe partakers are ever crowned with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and glory.</p>

And as arrogance is never without impudence, hee had been ſo unwiſe as to declare unto his wife the ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems whereof he had made uſe to cauſe <hi>Nilamon</hi> to periſh in the ſnares he had ſet for him.

And as a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance never goes alone, it happened that one of thoſe who had aſſiſted <hi>Appolinaire</hi> in the murther of <hi>Nilamon,</hi> being taken for another crime, before his execution confeſſed likewiſe this, which hee did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to have been done by a plot betweene <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Appolinaire.</hi> The words of <hi>Criſpine</hi> and of this man joyned to the conſcience of <hi>Tygris,</hi> which was to him as a thouſand witneſſes, caſt ſuch a terror in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſoule, that like another <hi>Caine</hi> he went his way wandring through the world, imagining that the bloud of his brother in law cried ſtill to heaven for vengeance againſt him.

This cry was heard by a maid that was in a Wardrobe neere: ſhe comes to the noyſe, and ſees her miſtreſſe calling for helpe, and defending her ſelfe couragiouſly againſt this impudent man, the maid runnes againſt the chamber door, gets it open, and ſet all the houſe in an uprore: the ſervants flock thither, incompaſſe <hi>Speuſippe</hi> on all ſides, &amp; hinder him from raviſhing <hi>Mela.</hi> He lays hold on the collar of one, and in a deſperate rage ſtabs him through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times with the poignard he had in his hand, and ſo kills him.

Wherein this good man reſembled the Goat in the fable, who ſuckled the young Wolfe, which beeing growne great did afterwards devour her.</p>
                     <p>This furious and impudent attempt ſo friendly forgiven, could not yet mollifie the wickedneſſe of his heart: but ſeeing all paſſages ſhut, and no way left him to approach <hi>Mela,</hi> who ſhuns him as the ſheep doth the wolfe, hee ſends a challenge to <hi>Liberat,</hi> whereby he lets him underſtand, that his extreame love making him more worthy than he to poſſeſſe faire <hi>Mela.</hi> Hee calls him to combat, to ſee unto whom the fortune of armes will give the conqueſt. Ah Foole, who knew not that by the Law a woman cannot marry the murtherer of her husband, but ſhe muſt make her ſelfe acceſſary and guilty of his death. <hi>Liberat</hi> preſſed as well by this fooliſh and falſe rule of honour, which paſſeth for a maxime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>France,</hi> as by the

Already they had hurt each other in divers places, and their bloud ſerved to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate them more on; when fortune, which is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes on the right ſide, permitted <hi>Liberats</hi> ſword to breake in the middle againſt the hilt of <hi>Speuſiippes</hi> dagger. <hi>Speuſippe</hi> then ſeeing the life of <hi>Liberat</hi> at his mercy, began to tell him that he muſt yeeld him his wife, or elſe he would preſently kill him. Thou mayſt take away my life, replied <hi>Liberat,</hi> but never myne honour, I wil die with that on my brow, and thou ſhalt live with the greateſt infamy wherewith a gentleman can be covered. You diſpute the caſe too long, ſaid <hi>Speuſippe,</hi> I muſt by the loſſe of thy life break the knot which is betwixt thee and <hi>Mela,</hi> the onely obſtacle to my deſires, that I may poſſeſſe her alone. Saying ſo he preſſes <hi>Liberat,</hi> who did but ward, and at laſt ſeeing himſelfe out of combat, he ſeekes his ſafety in his legs, and betakes himſelfe to flight. <hi>Speuſippe</hi> followed him, and as he went to thruſt his ſword into his backe, it happened that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berat</hi> fell, and <hi>Speuſippe</hi> ſtumbled over him, and hit his noſe ſo hard againſt the ground, that he lay quite
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7827:139"/> ſtund with the fall. <hi>Liberat</hi> loſing neither time nor judgement, gets upon him, ſtabs his poignard three or foure times in his belly, and made him yeeld up that unlucky ſoule, which after ſo many perfidious impudencies and deſperate furies went into its place. Such was the execrable end of this frantick mans attempts, an end which makes us ſee a juſt judgement of God upon his head, worthy indeed of a more cruell and of a more ignominious puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For what ſhameful execution did not he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, who with ſuch an inraged preſumption viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the lawes of friendſhip, of honour, of pudicity, and of piety, and did ſo many actions contrary to reaſon and equity? for my part, I expoſe him to the view of the world, as a man worthy of publique ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and whoſe memory ought to be deteſted by all thoſe that profeſſe an honorable friendſhip.</p>

It is an eaſie matter to plucke up a tree that is new ſet, and to beat downe a wall that is new made. A little Letter overthrew all the intents of <hi>Prelidian,</hi> and this ſparke ayded by the winde of temptation, made him repent the enterpriſe that he had begun: in lieu of ſtopping his eares againſt this faire inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, this Syren that would call him backe, to caſt him away by a lamentable wracke, the Idea of this beloved face gave him ſo many alarums in his Cel, that his reſolution yeelded unto the flattering vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of its aſſaults; and notwithſtanding all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances or admonitions made unto him by the Maſter of the Novices, he reſolved to returne.</p>

Foreſeeing himſelf weaned from the ſucceſſion of his brother, he makes account by the poſſeſſion of <hi>Parmene</hi> to recompenſe that loſſe, and thinkes that the eſtabliſhment of his fortune depends thereon: he now betakes himſelfe to viſit this woman carefully, and blames himſelfe towards her, with extraordinary reſpects and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions. <hi>Parmene</hi> imagins all this to bee as at the beginning of their frequentation, and that he courts her for his brother: but falling into this diſcourſe ſhe heares him ſing another note, and ſees that hee ſpeakes for himſelfe. This much perplexes the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Parmene,</hi> and indeed it was able to perplexe a ſtronger than hers, for recalling to her minde the ſweet thoughts ſhe had formerly framed on the fine qualities of <hi>Babilas,</hi> ſhe preſently falls into a relapſe of her firſt feaver, and the heat of love driving out the coldneſſe of deſpight of the loyalty of <hi>Prelidian,</hi> ſeemed to her but a fantaſme. How mutable a thing is a woman? even ſo variable, that they may bee ſayd to build on quicke-ſands, who lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their hopes on the faith of this ſexe.

It is reported ſaid ſhe, that <hi>Epolon</hi> deſires to marry you privately by night, without any ſhew or preparation. I doe therefore intreat you to put me in your place, and let me goe to Church in ſtead of you, and there in preſence of all the aſſiſtants, I will ſhew him his promiſe, and oblige him to marry me. This was in the winter ſeaſon, when the nights are at the longeſt; and the Church wherin this marriage ſhould be celebrated, was reaſonable farre from <hi>Philapians</hi> Caſtle. <hi>Aldegond</hi> conſents very willingly to <hi>Barſimee,</hi> whom ſhe promiſes to receive into her cloſet ſome

Hereupon ſhee goes into her cloſet, and having dreſſed <hi>Barſimee</hi> in her cloathes, this Widow masked and covered with a great ſcarfe becauſe of the night ayre, went onwards to the Church with <hi>Philapians</hi> wife, who tooke her to be her daughter. Meane while <hi>Alde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gond</hi> loſing no time, gets up on horſes which <hi>Metel</hi> had cauſed to be in readineſſe at the garden gate, and thus rid away with her beloved, who ſoone ſet her on the territories of <hi>Flanders,</hi> at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and which is to be admired at, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any intelligence. <hi>Tharſis</hi> was in ambuſcado in the way betweene the caſtle and the Church, who comes preſently with his men and incompaſſes the Coach, and takes <hi>Barſimee,</hi> thinking it had been <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degond.</hi> Meane time <hi>Victor</hi> playing the good ſonne and the loving brother, was at the Church with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polon</hi> and <hi>Philapian,</hi> whom he held in diſcourſe, and

Then <hi>Barſimee,</hi> growne bold by the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity whereunto ſhe ſaw her ſelfe reduced, holding <hi>Epolons</hi> promiſe of marriage in her hand, related from poynt to poynt the ſtratagem which ſhee had deviſed with <hi>Aldegond,</hi> yet ſhame retained her from declaring what <hi>Epolon</hi> had enjoyed. <hi>Tharſis</hi> on his ſide to juſtifie his action, excuſed himſelf by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive love he bare to <hi>Aldegond,</hi> and on the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which was given him to be a ſuiter unto her before <hi>Epolon</hi> ever ſaw her. Further proteſting that he brought backe <hi>Barſimee</hi> as entire as he had taken her away, and that he held her to bee a very honeſt
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7827:157"/> and worthy gentlewoman. At theſe words <hi>Epolon</hi> began to laugh, and intending to mocke both him and poore <hi>Barſimee,</hi> ſaid, It was a thing hard to bee beleeved, that he ſhould have ſo faire a gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in his power al night, without giving her ſome proofes of his valour, and that for his part were ſhee his wife, he would not deliver her into the keeping of ſuch a gentleman as <hi>Tharſis</hi> was without very ſtrong ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tharſis</hi> (who ſwore ſeriouſly and truly) grew an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at the old mans flouts, and redoubling his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, yet more ſolemnly than at the firſt, that <hi>Barſimee</hi> had been no otherwiſe uſed by him, than with all manner of honeſty and reſpect, and that ſhe was too wiſe to ſuffer her ſelfe to be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The conqueſt of her (replied the ſcoffer <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>) were more difficult for young men than for old, and ſhee had been leſſe favourable to you than to mee, who have not found her ſo untractable. Theſe words highly offended <hi>Tharſis,</hi> who finding himſelfe obliged to defend the honour of this lady, gave him this reply, Sir you ſpit upon your owne face, and this Lady being your owne true wife, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the promiſe which you have made her thereof; you diſhonour your ſelfe in touching her credit. She is not my wife, ſayd <hi>Epolon,</hi> neither is her honour mine, yet if ſhe had been wiſe, it may be I might have kept my promiſe, but I wil have none of your leavings; if you like her take her, I grutch you not my part. Theſe outragious ſpeeches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained <hi>Tharſis</hi> to reply in this manner; She is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therthy leavings nor mine, but deſerves a better
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7827:157"/> then thou art, and if thou wert wiſe thou wouldſt keepe thy word; never any honeſt man broke it, nor never any man of honour wronged a gentlewoman ſo cruelly. The protection which I owe her as a Knight, and the juſt pretention I have to <hi>Aldegond,</hi> makes me wiſh to ſee thee and I together with our ſwords in hand, that I might waſh the honour off the one in thy bloud, and make thee with the loſſe of thy life loſe the hope of the other, and it ſhall be when and where thou wilt that we ſhall meet. Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Epolon</hi> could not heare out the end of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, without laying hand on his weapon. <hi>Tharſis</hi> failed not to reply in the ſame accent, and before <hi>Philapian</hi> and <hi>Victor</hi> could ſeparate them, <hi>Tharſis</hi> had runne the old man into the body: preſently they were parted but it was too late, for <hi>Epolon</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a wound which left him but one dayes life. <hi>Victor</hi> being an intimate friend to <hi>Tharſis,</hi> helpt him away; who knowing he could never get his pardon, fled into <hi>Germany,</hi> where he died in the Emperours Army.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Epolon</hi> lived untill the next day, Heaven having lent him ſo much time as to call him to account, and to make ſatisfaction for the wrong he had don. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimee,</hi> to repaire her honour he gave her his land in ſigne of marriage, but ſuch a marriage whereof death ſoone unlooſed the bond.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day it was aſſuredly known that <hi>Alde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gond</hi> rather followed <hi>Metel,</hi> than that he had ſtollen her; and that if it were a Rape, it was done by her conſent. <hi>Philapian</hi> overcome with ſo many diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whether of griefe or of an apoplexy (which
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7827:158"/> as was thought ſeized on him) dyed ſuddenly. Not long after <hi>Metel</hi> having married <hi>Aldegond</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> brought all to a good paſſe again, and wrought his peace with the mother, who tenderly loved her daughter, and diſſwaded her ſonne <hi>Victor</hi> from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to right theſe affronts by the force of Armes.</p>
                     <p>Here the folly of <hi>Barſimee</hi> and the diſloyaltie of <hi>Epolon,</hi> ſerve to elevate or to make the loyalty and conſtancy of <hi>Metel</hi> and <hi>Aldegond</hi> ſhew the fairer.

Deare <hi>Valeria</hi> (replyed <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tran</hi>) the affection I beare you, being as ſtrong at death, workes now in mee the ſame effect, ſince it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates me from you: my vehement deſire of your greatneſſe, makes mee deprive my ſelfe of the greateſt contentment that I could have wiſhed, and without which my life hence forward ſhall be but a death: live then great, honoured, happy, rich, moſt deare <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and by marrying with <hi>Armentaire,</hi> become the glory of your kindred, whilſt I goe miſerable, poore, unhappy, and forlorne <hi>Metran</hi> ſpinning out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7827:161"/> of my ſad dayes amongſt the lovers of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: much adoe they had to plucke theſe lovers from each others preſence: a heart as hard as Adamant, could not but have relented at ſo hard a ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>The words of betrothing being rendred backe, the very next morrow, <hi>Valeria</hi> is promiſed to <hi>Armentaire,</hi> who in few dayes makes her a Counteſſe, and withall becomes ſo idolatrous of her, that both his eyes were not enough for him to view her withall; meane while <hi>Metran,</hi> who could rather have dyed, then indured to ſee his Miſtreſſe in the armes of another, went his way wandring through <hi>Italy</hi> for the ſpace of ſome few yeares, often changing place, but never heart nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. <hi>Armentarie</hi> had but one ſonne, and hee was married, but had no childe, and that was partly the cauſe why the Earle did marry againe to get iſſue, but age and the gowt oppoſed themſelves to his deſire.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, it was generally reported that hee was ſo charmed by the love of a Courtezan, that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained his lawfull wife: but as the kinde of bad wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men reſemble the <hi>materia prima,</hi> which is never ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with formes, what expence ſoever <hi>Hilaire</hi> was at for to ſtay the covetouſneſſe of this creature, ſhe ſtill flew out, and daily bred new diſtractions in his brain, ſo that on a time being throughly vexed at her, he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her like a woman of her trade, and marked her face with the ſlaſh of a ſharpe Raſor, which they there call Couſtillade. This lewd creature ſeeing her ſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of that little beauty which made her to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, grew ſo deſperate, that ſhe cauſed <hi>Halaire</hi> to be murthered by another of her lovers, with whom ſhe imbarked, and got into the Venetian Territories,

This his ſonnes death unmeaſurably afflicted the Earle, ſeeing himſelf deprived of heires, and out of all hope of having any children; yet the love he bare to his young wife, was a charme to all his griefes. But indeed this praiſe muſt onely be attributed to the vertuous diſcretion and carriage of <hi>Valeria,</hi> that ſhee could ſo well frame her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his humours, and ſo win his heart, that he had been inſenſible if hee had not acknowledged her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: the gowt by little and little waſting the Earles naturall vigour, brought him to the threſhold of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Some affaires forced <hi>Adiute</hi> to an abſence for ſome few dayes: during which time <hi>Iule</hi> invented a mask in favour of <hi>Eleuſipe,</hi> and cauſed her to be invited to a friends houſe of his, where being masked hee might entertaine her at will. Among thoſe whom he entreated to be maskers with him, was one <hi>Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riel</hi>
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:7827:165"/> young man, who danced exceeding well, and had formerly beene page to <hi>Adiute;</hi> the Maſque goes on, it is not for me to relate the invention, it ſufficeth for my hiſtory to ſay that it was don with the admiration of all the ſpectators, although they were ignorant both who was the principall author, and for whom it was made: ſo ſecret had <hi>Iule</hi> been in his enterpriſe. <hi>Audifax</hi> was there preſent, being come in that company where he knew <hi>Eleuſipe</hi> was to be. In maſques the liberty of Maſquers is very great by reaſon of their diſguiſe, they may as long as they pleaſe entertain with diſcourſe thoſe whom they chuſe out, and it were a groſſe incivility to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt them in their converſation, they beeing not bound ſo much as to anſwer any one that ſpeaks to them, except they pleaſe, that ſo they may not bee knowne by their ſpeech. The maſque being ended, <hi>Iule</hi> made uſe of the priviledge, and having taken <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuſipe</hi> aſide, talked with her in ſecret ſo long, till jealous <hi>Audifax</hi> was offended thereat. Hee had ſtil kept both his eies upon the actions of this Maſquer, who was talking to <hi>Eleuſipe</hi> with the countenance of a paſſionate man; which put <hi>Audifax</hi> into a fume, and for to breake off their diſcourſe he bethinkes himſelf to pray <hi>Eleuſipe</hi> to dance: ſhe excuſeth her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in that ſhe cannot without the Maſquers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, who ſeemed to be unwilling. This provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Audifax,</hi> and was the cauſe that thruſting the Maſquer, and calling him importunate man, would have taken <hi>Eleuſipe</hi> from him, the maſquer counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting his ſpeech<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſayd that hee made uſe of the maskes lawes without any importunity, but that he
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:7827:165"/> for his part did violate them with as much indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as incivility.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Audifax</hi> ſtung with theſe words, and more yet by his jealouſie, preſently layd hand on his ſword; but <hi>Iule</hi> was not without defence, for he made a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol ring in his eare, which had ſhot him through the head, had he not ſtopped it. The other Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers beſtirred themſelves likewiſe, ſo that there was an horrible confuſion. <hi>Iule</hi> was in the houſe of his friend, who helpt him at need: <hi>Audifax</hi> was ſlightly hurt, but evill fortune would, that as the Maſquers were retyring, poore <hi>Fleurid</hi> got a thruſt with a ſword in the backe, whereby he fell dead on the ſtaires. Being unmaskt and knowne, <hi>Audifax</hi> made no doubt but that this maske had been made by <hi>Adiute,</hi> in conſideration of <hi>Eleuſipe:</hi> The reaſon of this conjecture was, that <hi>Fluriel</hi> had beene his Page, and that commonly he had made uſe of him when he would make any maſque. The abſence of <hi>Adiute</hi> ſince ſome dayes ſhewed the contrary, but the jealouſie of <hi>Audifax</hi> made him beleeve that it was but feigned, and that it was ſo given out, the better to cover the mumming. Thereupon <hi>Audifax</hi> reſolved to challenge <hi>Adiute,</hi> who beeing returned to towne, ſaw himſelfe ſaluted by a letter of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which marked him out the houre and the place where he ſhould come with a ſecond to make ſatisfaction for the affront which <hi>Audifax</hi> pretended to have received from him. <hi>Adiute,</hi> who would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have payd deare for a good cauſe of quarrel againſt <hi>Audifax,</hi> receiveth this challenge with a free courage, asking no better than to decide by combat
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:7827:166"/> which of them ſhould have <hi>Eleuſipe.</hi> Further, being netled by the death of his Page, he reſolves to fight both for his Love and for his revenge, two ſtrong ſpurres to animate a ſpirit. Hee goes into the field with a ſecond, where before they went to it he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts by great oathes unto <hi>Audifax,</hi> that hee had not made the maſque, but that he was two dayes jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from thence when it was made: that he knew not what ſatisfaction <hi>Audifax</hi> would draw from a wrong that was not done by him: that he had cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage enough to accoaſt <hi>Eleuſipe</hi> openly without hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe under a maſque. This (replied <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difax</hi>) is the language of a coward, who to avoyd ſtrokes frames frivolous excuſes: wee are not come hither to ſtand and doe nothing, I am but too cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that it was thee who didſt make the Maſque, &amp; entertain my miſtres, notwithſtanding that thou wert forbidden ſo to do: the death of thy page hath been the beginning, and thine ſhall bee the end of my revenge, trifle not out time thus, wee muſt fight.</p>
                     <p>The wrong thou even now didſt mee (replied <hi>Adiute</hi>) in giving me the name of coward, which belongeth not unto me, would make me loſe a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand lives rather than want the waſhing of its ſpot in thy bloud: the bloud of my page killed treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly askes this vengeance, the love of my miſtres commands me to puniſh thy temerity, and my own honour obliges me to make thee lie.

They made him yeeld up his weapons, and ſo left him in the field, from whence being brought backe he died the next day; <hi>Adiutes</hi> Second having but a flight wound in the arme.</p>

The next day theſe maids which were thus lockt up, durſt not yet cry, thinking ſtill to have the knife at their throat: at laſt being farre on in the day, hearing no manner of noyſe in the houſe, they call out for helpe, they are delivered, &amp; it was found that the beſt things were ſtollen and carried away.

I bound my ſelfe in ſo ſtraight a friendſhip with <hi>Incmar</hi> a gentleman Native of <hi>Rottenburgh</hi> who had beene bred up as page unto the Lantgrave, that wee were commonly called the Inſeparable: thoſe impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which lovers feel when they are from their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, we felt when we loſt ſight one of another: being together dayes were unto us houres, and houres were moneths when we were aſunder, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was unto us an age, even in ſleeping, ſleepe which is a benumming of the powers, was unto us tedious if we were ſevered, by reaſon whereof wee commonly made but one bed, we had but one purſe and one table, one and the ſame houſe, the ſame ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, the ſame Livories, the ſame retinue, and when any of our ſervants were asked unto whom they did belong, they anſwered, Vnto the two friends, if thoſe that are but one may be called two: Wee went ſometimes to <hi>Rotemberg,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingnam,</hi> to ſee our common parents, he was at our houſe as at his owne, and I at his as at myne,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7827:181"/> in briefe, wee lived in an incomparable union.</p>
                     <p>It happened once as we were at <hi>Melſingnam,</hi> that my friend ſaw in a company a faire maid named <hi>Yoland,</hi> whoſe graces ſo woon his heart, that hee did nothing but thinke on her, and talked to me thereof out of the abundance of his thoughts. Preſently I judged him to be ſtung with her love, and hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged ſo much unto me at my firſt asking, for hee concealed nothing from mee. Truly, ſayd I to him, I am very glad that your affections have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves in a place where I may yeeld you aſſiſtance; for beſides that it is in my native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, I am ſomthing allyed unto this gentlewoman, and although it be a farre off, yet this affinity gives me a more particular acceſſe unto her, and by mee you may with more facility, and more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly introduce your ſelfe into her company, and from this frequentation paſſe into her favour: you have ſo much merit, that to ſee you, know you, and love you goe together. Then <hi>Incmar</hi> with tears in his eyes (but they were teares of joy) ſayd, Deare friend, thou thinkeſt that every one conſiders me as thou doſt, and that thy paſſion communicates its contagion unto others; I have not ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption as to thinke to breed affection in this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous minde, but it ſhall ſuffice mee that ſhee ſuffer me to honour her, and that the torments that I endure for her being acceptable, may bee a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the ſacrifice which I make unto her of my heart.</p>
                     <p>Thou art already replied I: in thoſe tearmes of Idolatrie which grow in the mouthes of lovers, and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7827:182"/> which (as I thinke) proceed but from the top of the lippes, otherwiſe theſe complements would offend heaven and would bee ſo many blaſphemies: for they ſpeake but of altars, of ſacrifices, of adorations, of flames, of victimes, of godeſſes, of temples, of vowes, of praiſes, of perfumes, and other ſuch idle thinges wherewith they entertaine their craized im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginations, thus replied <hi>Incmar,</hi> doe thoſe that are in health laugh at the actions of them that be ſicke of hot diſeaſes, in ſtead of having compaſſion on them: but if thou haſt any compaſſion on mine, for every lover is wounded, I pray thee to lend me thy helpe, and to beleeve that the greateſt proofes that thou canſt give mee of thy incomparable friendſhip, ſhalbe thy aſſiſtance in this occaſion, my love being to me no leſſe precious nor conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then my life: then did I promiſe to yeeld him all ſorts of good offices, and becauſe I feared that the iſſue of this deſigne would not ſucceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſires, after that I have laboured in vain to diſwade him this enterprize wherein I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved he ſhould unprofitably looſe his time, ſeeing that the obſtacles which I repreſented unto him augmented his ardor, and that the difficulties ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated him the more unto the purſuit, I ſwore unto him to paſſe over all conſiderations for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; being nothing was ſo deare unto mee in the world as to pleaſe him. I then found meanes divers times to make my faire kinſwoman be ſeene by my freind who having declared unto her his affection and diſcovered that this maide had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to acknowledge it, entred into great hops
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7827:182"/> the element of lovers, to ſee his pretentions arrive unto the port which he deſired.</p>
                     <p>I was every day at <hi>Yolandes</hi> eares relating unto her the commendable qualities of <hi>Inemar,</hi> and my owne affection making me eloquent, it was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for me to perſwade her what I my ſelfe belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for it is requiſit that the Orator be moved, who will move others: to inſpire love, one muſt have a feeling of its ſweet flame, this young bird by little and little ſuffered her ſelfe to bee brought on by my pipe, and to bee taken by the inevitable baites of <hi>Incmars</hi> converſations: now was he wholy in <hi>Yolands</hi> favour, but yet although the heart were wonne for to arrive unto the poſſeſſion of this faire body one of the ornaments of nature, theſe were obſtacles which appeared invincible, but what is there difficult what is there? impoſſible unto thoſe that will, and that love? <hi>Graciana</hi> ſtep Mother un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Yoland</hi> had married <hi>Raoul</hi> Father to this Maid, on condition that a ſonne that ſhee had by her firſt husband ſhould marry this gentlewoman; when as age had made her capable of marriage, <hi>Raoul</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſideration but of gold, whoſe duſt da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleth the eyes of the cleareſt ſighted, obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe unto this promiſe, not regarding that ſo to force the will is rather the part of a tyrant than of a Father, and then what obedience could have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, faire <hi>Yoland</hi> to give herſelfe unto a monſter, and to love him, who had all the cauſes which can give horror, he had a back higher then his head, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to eaſe <hi>Atlas</hi> of his burthen as well as <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> if he had beene tall enough and ſtrong enough,

                     <p>It availed not, though hee repreſented unto him the violence of his love, the maids affection to him, and the horror ſhe had of <hi>Hugolin,</hi> whom hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to be like a monſter, fitter to be ſmothered betwixt two beds, as a reproach of nature, than to lie in the armes of <hi>Yoland:</hi> Theſe were words caſt into the winde, and which in lieu of nullifying, the Prince put him into ſuch a chafe, that he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to bee put in priſon, for to teach him to ſpeak more diſcreetly; but in fine, ſome of <hi>Incmars</hi> friends which were preſent obtained his pardon of the Lantgrave, who conſented to his inlargement, upon condition that he ſhould be wiſer. <hi>Incmar</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the Prince, that hee would rather voluntarily baniſh himſelfe from his preſence and country, than to commit any thing therein that might be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

                     <p>She had a beauty of face annexed unto ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that if the one inflamed me with love, the other freezed me with feare, and I may ſay, that the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of my friend, and the love of this chaſt miſtreſſe, reigned in my heart with ſuch an equall counterpoiſe, that to die I would not have done any thing to the

And that was it that did ſweepe away from my ſpirit all the unjuſt thoughts that ſince might have there encreaſed, in revolting it ſelf againſt reaſon. To tell you ſomething of what paſſed in our Countrey after our flight, wee heard by ſome ſecret friends unto our parents, that the prince unmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly incenſed againſt us, ordained that the law ſhould proceed as againſt raviſhers, we were condemned to loſe our heads, but it was in <hi>effigie,</hi> our goods were confiſcate, in briefe, we were there uſed with all rigor, ſo that having no hope on that ſide, we ſetled it all on our owne valour, and committed our fortune to the hazard of armes. <hi>Incmar</hi> and I had done therein up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſions all that ſouldiers can doe which venture all; and brave <hi>Roland</hi> hath in all places ſhewen, that love which gave her courage, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

After many encounters we ſhut our ſelves up in <hi>Bliemberg,</hi> reſolving to ſhew in this ſiege the proofes of a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious valour in extream events, where there hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened what you have ſeene; military command ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeparated me from them, they have been killed on the breach; &amp; as it may be thought, <hi>Incmar</hi> being firſt dead, <hi>Yoland</hi> being not willing to ſurvive him, hath been killed on his body, and expiring embracing him. As for me I would have died in the forefront of the combat, if the brave but too pittiful Captain, who would not ſuffer me to be made an end of, had not cauſed me to be brought where I am, the loſſe of my bloud having layed mee among the dead.

Many remarkable morrals may bee drawne from this hiſtory; firſt, how ill Fathers doe in deſtinating their daughters unto young men which they abhorre, next where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto deſpaire carries amorous and unhappy ſoules, then, whereupon love raiſeth the courage of the weakeſt ſex, its fire being no leſſe admirable in its effects then that of thunder. In <hi>Aleran</hi> is ſeene the image of a faithfull friend, and of a lover imparalel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led who makes known the victory of friendſhip over love: this tragicall end diſcovers an admirable valour, and the generoſitie of the Marqueſſe hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the memory of theſe whom hee had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, ſerves for a ground which graceth or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out the gloſſe of all the other colours of this picture.</p>

                        <hi>Cyran</hi> going through the ſtreets in the City of <hi>Tours,</hi> which appeares a flower in the midſt of the garden of <hi>France,</hi> met with a poore ſouldier, who being but in bad array, had notwithſtanding a good aſpect, &amp; begged an almes of him with ſuch a grace that he felt himſelfe moved to give, but extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily moved, he put his hand into his pocket, and thinking to draw out a Sol, which is little more then an Engliſh penny, and gave it him with a good wil, and with words of honour and conſolation, wiſhed him a happy returne into his owne Country, and a better trade then warre, where moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:7827:190"/> is nothing to be gotten but blowes and lice, the ſouldier in a modeſt and civill manner anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, Sir God make mee able to do you ſome good ſervice, and confirme me in the deſire I have ſo to do, you beſtow a liberality on me in my preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing neceſſitie, which ſhall never die in my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; you do little leſſe then if you gave me life, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe words of complement they parted, and a while after <hi>Cyran</hi> having ended his affaires at <hi>Tours</hi> tooke leave of his friend, and returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his owne Countrey, as hee was croſſing a Wood there ſteps forth of a Coppice three theeves, whereof one layes hold on the bridle of his Horſe, and the other holding his ſword at his throat commands him to alight and follow them into the thicket of the Forreſt, when they were farr enough in, they ſearch him and take from him all the mony that he had, which was about a hundred French crownes with his cloake and beſt thinges, after this they begin to deliberate whether they ſhould kill him or no? let us kill him ſaide one, I know by his tongue that he is of this Countrie, and may diſcover us or cauſe us to be purſued, you ſay right ſaide another, if ſuch had killd him whom they robd, they ſhould not now hang on gibbets making mouthes at paſſengers, the third which was he unto whom <hi>Cyran</hi> ſome dayes before had given the almes of ſixpence in <hi>Tours,</hi> ſaid fellowes what good will his life do us, his blood will crie vengeance againſt us lowder then his voice, thou playeſt the preacher ſaid one of the other two, thoſe that uſe our trade ſhut their eies unto ſuch

                     <p>My friends, replied the good theef, I beg his life of you, and will rather give you my part of what hath bin taken from him: he is a gallant man, pray let us not kill him, I will teach you a good way both to ſave his life, and to provide for our ſafety: Let us binde him to ſome tree and leave him to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God, leſt we ſhould be ſpotted with his bloud.</p>
                     <p>This counſell was followed, <hi>Cyran</hi> was bound to a tree with the bridle of his horſe and his garters, and the theeves tooke his horſe and his things and left him there. The good theefe as he was binding of him ſayd in his eare, Friend take courage, this night will I come and unbinde thee, I have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thy almes deed. <hi>Cyran</hi> remained in this caſe all the reſt of the day, hoping ſtill in the mercy of God, and in the promiſe of the good Theefe. But towards night hee entered into terrours of death, when as it began to be darke, and hee heard the Wolves howling in the Forreſt, whereof hee ſaw two paſſe cloſe by him, and were a good while loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on his countenance. For beſides the cruelty of this beaſt, he is likewiſe ſo extreame crafty and diſtruſtfull, that even when a traine is layd for him, yet is he hard to be taken, and is afraid of all things: hee ſhunnes ſnares, hee lookes, hee hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, he conſiders, he watches. Already they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:7827:191"/> to approach nearer, for to ſmell him, and that they might ſet on him in a troup and eate him up, they called their fellowes together by howling, wherewithall the forreſt did ring, and the ecchoes multiplying their voyces, made <hi>Cyrans</hi> eares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that there was a legion of Wolves comming to devoure him. Surely if the good theeves helpe had ſtayd a little longer, it is likely that it had come too late, and out of ſeaſon, and had found poore <hi>Cyran</hi> torne to pieces by Wolves. But God who helpes in tribulation, and whoſe aſſiſtance comes in fit time, made him arrive at the very inſtant, which was needfull to deliver <hi>Cyran</hi> not onely from the feare of death, but from the death of feare, for ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had almoſt borne away his ſoule. I leave to your conſideration, with what words he thanked the good theefe, who had twice in one day ſaved his life, firſt in drawing him forth out of the jawes of Lions, which were the other two theeves, and then of Wolves, which are Theeves that live but by rapine; he profered the Souldier to uſe him as his brother, and to give him ſuch part of his meanes as hee ſhould therewith bee content, if hee would go with him, and leave this wicked courſe of life, which could not leade him but to a ſhamefull end. To give ouer this theeving life, ſaid the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, that is a thing that I am reſolved to do, having long ſince conceived ſuch a horror thereof, that it ſeemeth to me a hell. My intent is to be a religious man, to repent for ſo many evils which I have done in this unlucky trade: it is true that I did never kill,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7827:192"/> but I have beene preſent at many murthers; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to robbe, preſſed by neceſſitie, but I have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by a certaine malignant delight that therein is to be taken, ſeeing it ſerves to maintaine wickednes, finding not ſafety enough in <hi>France,</hi> where I ſhould ever thinke juſtice to be at my heeles, I doe entreat you to pray to God for me, that he may continue in me his good inſpiration, and may give me grace to put this good deſigne in execution; there is the part which I have had of the hundred crowns that were taken from you, I reſtore it you with a good will, &amp; in ſo ſaying he would have put a hundred Franks into his hands. Yet <hi>Cyran</hi> would never take them backe againe, but gave them him in almes to helpe him in his pilgrimage, offering to give him yet more, if hee would goe with him to the next City. The penitent ſouldier (for I ſhould make a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to call him theefe after ſuch a change) thanked him, and having mutually embraced each other, and mixt their teares together, <hi>Cyran</hi> tooke his journey one way, and the ſouldier the other; whom hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw ſince, but the other two he did, for about ſome three moneths after being diſcovered by the Cloake and horſe of <hi>Cyran,</hi> and accuſed of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thefts, they fell into the hands of the Provoſt Marſhal, who did them good and ſpeedy juſtice, and ſo they were faſtened unto an unlucky tree called a gybbet, from whence they came down by hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</p>
                     <p>The good fortune of Almeſdeeds ſhines in this relation with ſuch ſplendour, that although there were
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:7827:192"/> were no other motive to uſe liberality towards mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable perſons, this were argument ſufficient to draw it forth of the hands even of Avarice it ſelfe.</p>
